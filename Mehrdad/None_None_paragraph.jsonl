{"paragraph": "Susan agreed and we started our search. On one scouting trip we had just\nabout given up when we spotted a tiny Polaroid black-and-white photo in a\nrealtor\u2019s window in Ellsworth, Maine, listing a property \u201cca 200 acres with\nbuildings\u201d in Blue Hill, for $25,000. A few hours later we bought it, for the\nasking price. It\u2019s a good thing we didn\u2019t dicker. Over Christmas the owner\ndecided to take it off the market and try to sell it for a higher price with a\nfancier real estate company, but the law in Maine then required a seller to\nsell to anyone offering the asking price\u2014a wise measure to prevent\ndiscrimination\u2014and our lawyer, the redoubtable Charles Hurley of Hale &\nHamlin, successfully insisted that the owner accept our offer. Thus began\nour life at Godland Farm, where we spent every summer for the next forty\nyears. (Parson Jonathan Fisher, an eighteenth-century clergyman and\nscholar in Blue Hill, made a map of the area\u2014now in the Jonathan Fisher\n\fHouse Museum in Blue Hill\u2014which showed every house and lane, but our\ntwo hundred acres did not yet have buildings, so the location is marked with\nthe word \u201cGodland,\u201d which meant nobody\u2019s land yet. We decided this\nwould be a good name for the farm and the cider wine we made there, and\nfor us the name had nothing to do with religion.)\n    We drove east for the summer of 1970, our last childless summer, to\nconfront the farmhouse we\u2019d purchased. \u201cWe\u2019re out of our minds!\u201d I\nremember saying to Susan as we drove up to the place for the first time, its\ndooryard littered with abandoned cars and trucks, our water supply a nickel-\nplated hand pump in the kitchen sink connected to the backyard well, a\nthree-holer outhouse our only toilet, a grand total of three electrical outlets\nin the whole house, and junk piled everywhere. At first the insurance\ncompany refused to insure the place, thinking we just planned to burn it\ndown and build something else, but our agent convinced them that we were\na crazy dreamy couple from California who actually planned to restore the\nplace to its original glory. Susan\u2019s brother George, just out of the Marines,\nhelped with the restoration work. We loved our Blue Hill neighbors, all\nnative Mainers who were a steady source of instruction and help, and in\ntime we made such progress that we decided that driving to Maine from\nIrvine every summer would make no sense.", "location": 233765}
{"paragraph": "A  NDREW     WOODFIELD, A YOUNG BRITISH PHILOSOPHER at the University of\nBristol, got a Fulbright award to bring two American philosophers of mind\nto Bristol for an intense term of workshops in the fall of 1978, and he chose\nto invite Stephen Stich and me. As I was pondering this good prospect, I got\nan invitation from Derek Parfit to return to Oxford for a year as a visiting\nfellow at All Souls College. That settled it; we\u2019d take the family to Bristol\nfor the fall and Oxford for the winter and spring. But then another invitation\ncame through from John McCarthy at Stanford, who had a grant to create a\nyearlong working group at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral\nSciences, in Palo Alto, on philosophy and artificial intelligence. I was able\nto convince John to hold off until 1979\u201380 so the Dennetts could spend a\nyear in England and then a year in California. And I convinced Tufts to let\nme take off for two consecutive years, one a sabbatical and one an unpaid\nleave of absence. Lucky me. Lucky us.\n    Woodfield found us a house, the home of a professor on leave in the\nStates, in Montpelier, a newly gentrifying area of Bristol, and we enrolled\nAndrea and Peter, aged seven and five, in the Sefton Park primary school, a\nshort walk up from our hillside house, from which we could watch hot-air\nballoons by the dozens drifting by on most calm mornings. When I say the\nneighborhood was gentrifying, I mean just barely. Our house was in a long\nattached row of city houses. The house next door was abandoned, roof\n\fcaving in, with boarded-up windows. There were other abandoned houses\non the street and on neighboring streets, so this area did not look inviting.\nAndrew had driven us from Heathrow to the house, and my heart sank\nwhen he stopped the car opposite an unfriendly three-story wall of solid\nbrick. A small door, so small I had to bend over to get through it, was the\nonly aperture in this windowless wall. But once inside, we discovered that it\nwas a delightful, sunlit house just one room deep, like a doll house. It had a\nwalled back garden with an old tire swing on the limb of an ancient apple\ntree, and lots of big windows that filled the house with light on even the\ngloomiest days. It even had a grand piano.\n    The first or second day we were there, we went for a walk around the\nneighborhood, checking out the little shops nearby, and soon we realized\nthat three or four children were quietly following us, curious about their\nnew neighbors. We smiled at them and eventually the boldest of the little\nboys dared to address us: \u201cYou\u2019re Americans, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n    \u201cYes,\u201d I replied.\n    \u201cDo you know Darth Vader?\u201d\n    \u201cWell, not personally.\u201d\n    Our own kids soon found that they were entirely welcome in the\nmulticultural neighborhood, playing in the streets and the adventure\nplayground two streets down the hill and visiting their playmates\u2019 homes.\nWhen an ice storm left the roads impassable to cars, the kids found\ncardboard boxes to turn into sleds and went careening down the streets at a\nterrifying speed, but nobody got hurt.\n    The Fulbright workshop on philosophy of mind concentrated on topics\nthat were then occupying some of the brightest talents in the field: how to\nmake sense of claims such as \u201cx believes that p,\u201d which seem simple\nenough at first glance but exhibit logical peculiarities that had frustrated the\nefforts of Frege, Russell, and Quine, among others. The people working on\nthese issues were somewhat jocularly known to many as the Propositional\nAttitude Task Force, and Steve Stich and I had both contributed to this\nliterature. But we both harbored the suspicion that the usual setting of the\nissues was in some way artifactual, fundamentally misconstruing the\nphenomena. We decided to coauthor a paper attacking the foundational\n\fconcept of \u201cpropositional attitudes,\u201d but after several months of drafting\nand discussion we decided to go our separate ways. This resulted in my\n1982 paper \u201cBeyond Belief\u201d and Steve\u2019s 1983 book, From Folk Psychology\nto Cognitive Science: The Case against Belief. Steve later changed his\nmind, but I haven\u2019t budged. More on that later.\n   The Bristol workshop was intense and happy, spilling over into\ndiscussions at lunch in the faculty club, where we were often joined by\nnonphilosophers. One mathematician who vigorously participated (I forget\nhis name, alas) was enticed into reading Quine\u2019s Word and Object, and\nasked me at lunch one day why it was that whenever Quine got into real\nmetaphysical issues he \u201ccracked wise,\u201d jocularly evading the problems. It\nhad never occurred to me that Quine did this, but I was soon persuaded that\nthe fellow was right. I ventured a diagnosis: Quine started out as a\nmathematical logician and had never been quite sure that philosophy was a\nproper career for a grown-up; it was his residual discomfort with the field\nhe was in that explained his arm\u2019s-length approach to metaphysics. Years\nlater, I told Quine this story, and he readily confirmed my diagnosis: Quine\nwas a philosopher malgr\u00e9 lui. Me too, I thought. Another nonphilosopher\nwho joined in the discussion was the physicist Michael Berry, to whom I\nam grateful for tutoring me on chance, chaos, and indeterminism.\n   The most welcome interloper was the psychologist Richard Gregory,\nwho had no official role in the Fulbright program but who entertained us,\ngrilled us, informed us, and in the process became a dear friend of mine.\nRichard was larger than life, in several ways. He was tall and playful, and\nhis enthusiasm knew no bounds as he peppered us with puzzles, questions,\ncurious psychological facts, and awful puns. He was a pied piper with\nchildren; when he threw a dinner party for the Fulbright group in his elegant\ncrescent apartment in Clifton, filled with telescopes and antique scientific\ninstruments, he showed our children some of the marvels and then settled\nthem on his bed to watch cartoons and David Attenborough videos while\nthe adults had their own party in the living room. Here was a great\npsychologist who got the point of philosophy\u2014or thought he did; his bold\n\u201cmisreadings\u201d of some philosophical texts were often actually\nimprovements, in my opinion. He was in the process of creating the Bristol\n\fExploratory, modeled somewhat on the Exploratorium in San Francisco, a\nscience museum where you got to touch and fiddle with everything and\nscience was fun. Famous for his visual illusions, he put together an\nawesome collection of astounding items, fascinating to children and adults\nalike. Every day when I walked from our house in Montpelier to the\nuniversity, I walked by a caf\u00e9 wall whose tiles happened to create a visual\nillusion; I never noticed it, but one of Richard\u2019s graduate students did, and\nRichard made it famous among vision scientists.\n    It was Richard who first impressed on me the idea that tools make you\nsmarter. Microscopes and maps and diagrams are obviously cognitive aids,\nbut even a pair of scissors can on occasion help you solve a problem. Many\ntools are not concrete artifacts but methods, attitudes, algorithms. Nobody\ninvented language and nobody knows who\u2014if anybody\u2014deserves credit\nfor inventing the hammer or the knife or the number zero or writing, and\nmany of the best tools for thinking have arisen through multiple more or\nless simultaneous inventions and improvements. Who invented the\ntelescope, the computer, calculus? Over time human culture has generated a\nbounty of techniques and devices for finding things out, and we are the only\nspecies on the planet whose brains are well furnished with all these tools.\nThis has been a major theme in my work, the Tower of Generate and Test,\nstarting with Darwinian creatures that are born with many clever instincts\nthat evolved by natural selection, Skinnerian creatures that can evolve novel\nbehaviors by trial and error in the environment, Popperian creatures that can\ndo some of the trial and error in their heads (much less risky!), and\nGregorian creatures that can explore the vast space of possible solutions to\nproblems with the help of thousands of culturally inherited thinking tools.\nThese thinking tools are, as I said in Intuition Pumps (2013), apps that are\nall available to be downloaded to your necktop for free.\n    Richard and I met often at scientific conferences in England and\nelsewhere, and I particularly cherish the memory of a splendid breakfast we\nDennetts had with him in a hotel overlooking the Clifton suspension bridge,\nwhere he once again beguiled our children, who were having their second\nstay in England while I gave the Locke Lectures in Oxford. On another\noccasion when I stayed with Richard, he had just come back from one of\n\fthe fabulous Garden Parties Queen Elizabeth gave in the gardens behind\nBuckingham Palace. Richard had been invited, and he reported with glee\nwhat had happened there. The queen had been chatting with some\ngentleman guest when one of her corgis assaulted one of his well-trousered\nlegs. He tried to shake off the dog while continuing the chat, without\nsuccess. \u201cKick his balls!\u201d said the queen. The fellow paused. \u201cKick his\nballs!\u201d she repeated. So, he did. \u201cHis croquet balls!\u201d she explained.\n    It was through Richard that I got to know two of his former students, V.\nS. Ramachandran and Susan Blackmore, both of whom have played major\nroles in my education. He also encouraged me to think of experiments that\ncould test some of the ideas I was percolating about consciousness. In my\n1991 book, Consciousness Explained, I describe the British neurosurgeon\nGrey Walter\u2019s \u201cprecognitive carousel,\u201d an early experiment in which he\nimplanted electrodes in the motor cortex of human patients/subjects and\ndemonstrated that they could change viewing-slides just by forming the\nintention to do so, while pushing a dummy button not attached to the slide\nprojector. Grey Walter had explained this experiment to a rapt group of\nmedical students (and me) at an Osler Society meeting in Oxford in 1963.\nHe reported that his patients/subjects were surprised to find the carousel\n\u201canticipating\u201d their decisions, just as they were about to press the button.\nThe tiny time lag between decision and finger-muscle contraction was\nmissing, giving them an illusion of a mind-reading slide projector. This\nremarkable but easy-to-explain \u201cfinding\u201d got me thinking about time\nperception, which was a major topic in my 1991 book. Many researchers\nwho read my book wanted to know more and could find no published work\nby Grey Walter that described any such experiment. Richard had known\nGrey Walter well and had access to his papers, stored in the Burden\nNeurological Institute, an imposing edifice on a hill outside Bristol. He and\nhis assistant, Patricia Heard, searched through all the files and found no\naccount of the experiment Grey Walter had described. So perhaps the great\nman had told a fictitious tale to those credulous young medical students of\nan experiment he had envisioned but never performed. Thanks to advances\nin technology, it should now be possible to do versions of that experiment\nwithout drilling holes in people\u2019s skulls and implanting electrodes. But\n\falthough several scientists have discussed with me the prospect of doing\nsuch versions, I still do not know of definitive peer-reviewed results either\nconfirming or disconfirming the precognitive-carousel effect.", "location": 352602}
{"paragraph": "If you start singing on do and go up the scale to the octave (as in that\nawful song from The Sound of Music), you have sung the major scale\u2014the\nIonian mode. If you sing the same notes but start and end on re, you are\nsinging the Dorian mode. And so forth. It is a wonderful fact that you can\ntreat any of the seven notes as \u201chome\u201d and get a different feeling (effect,\ncolor, atmosphere) depending on which mode you choose. (Miles Davis\u2019s\nalbum Kind of Blue is a great example of \u201cmodal\u201d jazz.) The same is true,\nin principle, of painting! As the philosopher of art Arthur Danto once put it\nin an essay on Norman Rockwell, \u201cPainting is not simply what takes place\non the canvas. It is what goes on between the canvas and the viewer.\u201d\nPerhaps Poussin had meant his viewer to begin by looking at the lady\u2019s\nface, then at the child\u2019s hand, then at the bright red hat on the onlooker, and\nso forth, until the viewer\u2019s gaze had taken in all the key points of interest in\nthe painting. Suppose we gathered eye-tracking data on many people\nlooking at paintings and then added a do-re-mi soundtrack to the recording\nof their saccades. We could then hear the difference between how two\nsubjects looked at the same painting. Maybe some people don\u2019t like some\npaintings because they are looking at them in the wrong mode! With the\nhelp of Steven Franconeri, a Harvard graduate student in experimental\npsychology, and a few undergraduates and others, we set up an experiment\nusing an eye tracker and a program that assigned musical tones to locations\non paintings. We then listened to people looking at pictures (they couldn\u2019t\nhear the tones, which we added later). Adding the soundtrack made a huge\ndifference. When spots appeared on the computer screen\u2014one for each\nsaccade\u2014it was almost impossible to detect patterns in successive subjects\u2019\nresponses to a painting. Add the sound and you got melodies of sorts, with\nrhythms, easily distinguishable and even memorable. We had to recalibrate\nthe eye tracker often, and because we didn\u2019t want the subjects to be self-\nconscious about their saccades, we used the recalibration process as a fake\nexperiment, telling the subjects that while we tinkered with the equipment\nthey could just relax and look at some pictures, which was when the actual\n\fdata-gathering happened. But it was an inefficient process; furthermore, the\nstudent who was doing most of the work graduated, so we would have had\nto start over with more subjects and more assistants. The experiment was\nconsigned to the file drawer, but my belief is that there are lots of revealing\nexperiments, on vision, on attention, on the role of color and shape in\nentraining saccades, that this paradigm could fruitfully explore, and eye\ntrackers are more sensitive, reliable, and user-friendly these days, so I hope\nthese avenues are pursued.\n    One of the early readers of Consciousness Explained was Euan Baird,\nthe CEO of Schlumberger, the global energy-technology company. He\nthought the book had lessons about corporations as well as consciousness\u2014\nbreaking down the myth of the Central Boss who controlled everything\u2014\nand he bought dozens of copies and sent them to all the heads of the various\nbranches of Schlumberger around the world. He also invited me to give a\ntalk about it at two of the annual meetings of these company leaders. The\nfirst was in Paris. I had never been invited to speak to such an audience and\nthought I was driving a hard bargain when I asked for $10,000 for each talk,\nfirst-class airfare, and a new Mac computer on which I would demonstrate\nsome of the phenomena I had written about in my book. He agreed on the\nspot, and as soon as the Mac was delivered to me, I took it over to Patrick\nCavanagh\u2019s vision lab at Harvard, and he helped me devise the software I\nneeded, using the excellent Macglib software they had developed. A few\nhours in his lab in William James Hall left me with stunningly effective\ndemos of two phenomena I had described at some length in my book: color\nphi and metacontrast. If you display two red shapes one after another, with\none displaced a smallish amount, you get a standard phi phenomenon:\napparent motion with a single red shape moving\u2014this is how movies work,\nof course. What if you change the color of the shape? Does the phi\nphenomenon go away, or does the \u201cmoving\u201d shape also change color, and if\nso, does it change before it moves, after it moves, or during the move? If\nyou get the timing and distance apart just right, it changes color in the\nmiddle of its (illusory) trajectory! The puzzle for many people was: How\ndoes the brain know where and when to change the color of the illusory\nshape when it hasn\u2019t yet perceived the second image? Thanks to the\n\fversatile software Patrick made for me, I could adjust the display in real\ntime while I showed it to whatever audience was present. I could change the\ndistance apart and the timing of the appearance of the different colored\nshapes\u2014disks, in fact\u2014so that in a large amphitheater the people in the\nback got the effect at one setting and the people in the front got the effect at\nanother setting. (The colors and the direction of the motion were also\nadjustable, ruling out \u201cpractice effects\u201d that could possibly explain the\nbrain\u2019s ability to \u201cprecognize\u201d the direction and color of the illusion it was\ncreating. There was no precognition, of course, but explaining the effect\nwithout resorting to such revolutionary hypotheses was the path forward.)\n    The metacontrast demo was, if anything, even more spectacular: in\nmetacontrast, a first stimulus (an image of a disk, say) is followed\nimmediately by a second image (an image of a ring shape that fits around\nwhere the disk was\u2014see figure 6.1 in Consciousness Explained, p. 141),\nand when you get the timing right the first stimulus simply disappears;\nsubjects report seeing only the ring! Their memories of seeing the disk are\nwiped clean, it seems. In the demo, there were two disks, left and right,\nflashing in unison, and a single ring to the right. At slow speeds, both disks\nwere visible, followed immediately by the single ring on the right. As I\nadjusted the speed up, the disk on the right simply disappeared: the disk on\nthe left appeared clearly, while its twin (in size, color, and duration)\nvanished. I had great fun showing these demos to dozens of audiences,\nalong with the Grimes video, and they clearly played a major role in\nenhancing my credibility as a consciousness theorist whom scientists should\ntake seriously, inspiring a wave of experimentation around the world.\n    The BBC in the UK had a science program called Antenna, which\npresented controversial scientific views in well-produced opinion-\ndocumentaries with critics and responses included. They invited me to\nmake an episode, which eventually was titled (over my strenuous\nobjections) \u201cMind Movies,\u201d and it included comments from my friendly\ncritics \u201cRama\u201d Ramachandran and Igor Aleksander, an\nengineer/neuroscientist at Imperial College London. One of the design\nprinciples then reigning at the BBC was that science documentaries should\nbe visually fascinating\u2014they should minimize \u201ctalking heads\u201d and\n\fmaximize arresting scenes. In some ways, this was perfect for my\ndocumentary, since I got to show demonstrations of metacontrast and one of\nmy favorite phenomena: the \u201croom full of Marilyns\u201d (Consciousness\nExplained, p. 354). If you walked into a room, turned on the lights, and saw\nthat the walls were papered with identical large photos of, say, Marilyn\nMonroe, you would pick this up immediately, but here\u2019s a puzzle: You can\nrecognize a person in a photograph only by foveating it (saccading to it so\nthat the high-resolution part of your retina is aimed at it), but it would take\nmany seconds to foveate many Marilyns. How does the brain manage to\ncreate your belief that all the Marilyns you see are identical images of the\nsame person? It seems that your visual experience is high resolution all the\nway out to the periphery, but that is an illusion. I asked the BBC if we could\ninclude just such a scene in the documentary and they agreed. It ended up\ncosting them hundreds of pounds to get permission to make and display\nabout fifty huge photographs of Marilyn Monroe, which we carefully\ntacked up on three walls of a small art gallery at Tufts where parts of the\ndocumentary were filmed.\n    I was very happy with the result of that scene, but the BBC\u2019s thirst for\nvisual interest backfired in other ways. The young producer filmed me\nriding at night through Boston in a taxi to a cinema, where she had me order\na hot dog at the concession stand (in spite of my insistence that cinemas in\nthe US didn\u2019t usually sell hot dogs). I was seen at the helm of a sailboat\nnarrowly avoiding a buoy, walking inside the giant home computer I had\nhelped design at Boston\u2019s Computer Museum, and strolling inside the\n\u201cMapparium,\u201d a giant inside-out glass globe map of the world as it was in\n1935, a tourist attraction at Boston\u2019s world headquarters of the Christian\nScience religion, in the Mary Baker Eddy Library. This was all visually\nspectacular, but when I quizzed students and colleagues after they had seen\nthe finished documentary, they remembered the settings vividly but couldn\u2019t\nrecall what I had said! I discussed this issue with various media-savvy\nfriends afterward, and we had fun imagining the satire of a BBC science\ndocumentary we could make, with Hans Krebs trying to explain the Krebs\ncycle while riding a wooden pony on a merry-go-round, Stephen Hawking\nin a miner\u2019s helmet talking about black holes while seated in his electric\n\fwheelchair at the bottom of a coal mine, and Watson and Crick hanging on\nfor dear life to the rungs of a gigantic revolving DNA double helix. In the\nfinal editing, the producer of \u201cMind Movies\u201d also cut a crucial qualifier\nfrom my response to Ramachandran, making nonsense of the exchange, so\nwhile it was another interesting adventure in filmmaking, I\u2019m happy that\nit\u2019s not available on YouTube among a hundred or so other videos of me. I\ndid, however, get one salutary challenge from the producer, which has\ninfluenced much of my later work. During our early meetings on the\ncontent to be presented, I showed her several diagrams of consciousness\nthat had been published by scientists, and heaped criticism on them. \u201cI get\nyour objections,\u201d she said, \u201cbut where is your diagram of consciousness?\u201d\nThis led me to develop a series of diagrams, with moving parts, that I used\nwhenever I presented my theory in talks. This was before PowerPoint, so I\nhad \u201coverhead transparencies\u201d that could be moved and layered, and my\ntalks were much more effective as a result. I once gave a very formal\nlecture in the Netherlands and my host introduced me by saying, \u201cProfessor\nDennett will be accompanying himself on the overhead projector.\u201d I miss\nthem; there are some effects that are more vividly achieved by sliding\ntransparencies over each other than by animating the effect with computer\ngraphics.", "location": 541170}

{"paragraph": "The Dennetts with Bo Dahlbom\n\fANDREA AND PETER GREW UP on the farm from infancy. They gathered the\neggs from the henhouse, fed the pig in the barn, and for a few years Andrea\nhad a horse, April Star, to ride and care for. April Star sometimes got lonely\nin her pasture and jumped the electric fence I\u2019d installed, but a neighbor\nwould soon walk her back along the gravel road. The problem was solved\nby borrowing a little Shetland pony, Tootsie Roll, from the stable in\nMassachusetts where April Star spent the winter, to keep her company. We\nhad a horse trailer and all kinds of horse gear. We\u2019d also take the hens back\nto Andover for the winter to a nice sunny room in our carriage house,\ntransporting them in an airy wooden crate on the roof rack. I remember a\ngas station attendant being startled when he overheard me talking gently to\nthe hens while he pumped gas; he thought I had a person in the crate. We\nraised only one pig. I had wanted to name it Pork Chop, or something\nsimilar, but Peter insisted it be called Curious, after Curious George, his\nfavorite book character, and there can\u2019t be a more challenging name for a\nfood animal than that. I was concerned about how to deal with the kids\u2019\nrealization when Curious came back from the slaughterhouse in dozens of\npieces all wrapped up in butcher paper. We unloaded the packages into the\nfreezer, and all was calm until we got to the bottom of the last box. There,\nunder the wrapped slabs of bacon soon to be sent to Newt Grindle for\nsmoking, was the head of Curious, unwrapped and neatly sawn in half, left\nand right side, by the butcher\u2019s band saw. Peter jumped, but then grew\ncurious himself, and a lengthy anatomy lesson followed. He wanted to take\nhalf the head to show-and-tell at school when we got back to\nMassachusetts, but we decided that might be a little too disturbing for his\nfellow first graders. Andrea solemnly told us that she had promised God she\nwouldn\u2019t eat any of Curious, but she forgot her vow, a lapse we let pass\nwithout comment.\n    I remember sitting on the steps of the shed with Andrea, aged about two,\nshucking clams I\u2019d just raked for a chowder while she watched and played\nwith the clams in the saucepan, eventually draping the fragrant globs all\n\fover her head, creating a raw-clam tiara that I considered her self-\ncoronation as a Maine girl, which she is to this day. Peter and I built the\nPetermobile, a racing car powered by a leftover lawn-mower engine, with a\nhomemade clutch and wooden brakes that pressed hard on the rear tires\nwhen you stepped on the brake pedal. His first drive, across our bumpy\nlawn, was a bounding accident-in-the-making, but I managed to stop it\nbefore it hit the giant elm tree; I found some gears to put it in a safer speed\nrange. We also built a fort in the woods and a tree house about twenty feet\nup in a wolf pine. (A wolf pine is a white pine whose leader, or terminal\nbranch, was hit by a pine weevil early in its life, causing it to have multiple\ntrunks growing into a gigantic candelabra, instead of a single stately, usable\ntrunk. Wolf pines are often left standing in the woods because they are no\nuse for lumber but are prodigious sources of pine cones that can seed the\nnext generation.) Peter\u2019s tree house had a worn-out oriental rug on its\nplatform and a secret rope ladder\u2014along with a decoy ladder that was\ndesigned to break once an adult started to climb it.\n   One major forestry operation involved cutting hundreds of mature\nspruce, pine, and cedar trees for sawlogs, in addition to firewood and fir\npulpwood. The loggers used the latest computer-controlled harvesting\nmachines, which could fell and limb a large spruce in less than a minute, a\nfar cry from the chain saws and woods horses we had used on earlier\nlogging adventures. Some of my happiest farm memories are from when\nour friend Paul Birdsall was winter-logging with his Belgian work horses in\nour woods and lodging the gentle giants in our barn. I recall the smell of\nfresh hay and horse manure, and the shaggy horses themselves, steaming in\ntheir stalls in zero-degree weather after being brought in from hauling\npulpwood on a cord-and-a-half sled, which we had loaded using our pulp\nhooks, a simple tool that turns an ordinary man into an Incredible Hulk,\nable to lift and load four-foot-long logs with ease. I have a photo of Paul\nriding a giant spruce log close to three feet in diameter and sixteen feet\nlong, its front end jacked up (with our peaveys) and chained onto a pung (a\nshort strong sled) being pulled through the snow by his team of Belgians.\nNot the fastest way to log, but an experience to savor forever.\n\f    Andrea and Peter enjoyed the friendship of Dylan McTighe, about the\nsame age as Andrea, who lived up the road with his grandmother, Fern\nMcTighe, the librarian in the Blue Hill Public Library (and the source of the\ngiven name of the little girl in Charlotte\u2019s Web, written by our Brooklin\nneighbor, E. B. White). Dylan announced his friendship by giving Andrea a\nlive garter snake he had just caught, and this was the first inhabitant of a\nserpentarium that soon included ring-necked snakes and green snakes and\nredbellied snakes. An old black pickup truck hood lay on the edge of one of\nour blueberry fields, and when I lifted it up one day, I found about ten\nsnakes of different species warming themselves under its sunbaked dome.\nThis became our main snake trap. Almost any sunny day you could find a\nfew snakes resting under the hood, and it was often an easy matter to reach\ndown and grab one. I learned then that children can be a great booster of\ncharacter, since no dad or mom wants to be seen as a fraidy-cat or sissy\naround their kids. I steeled myself and learned to pick up snakes with\naplomb. One day, after we\u2019d had a magnificent bonfire of trashwood and\nbrush (duly superintended by adults with Indian Pumps on their backs), I\nfound some snake eggs, presumably poached, in a rotten stump that had\nbeen charred but not burned to ashes. I carefully pulled out the leathery\nwhite eggs and called the kids for a biology lesson, using my razor-sharp\njackknife and some pins to splay open the eggs, and unroll the tiny snakes,\nsmaller than earthworms, onto my dissecting board. To our astonishment,\nseveral of them began to move and were promptly added to the\nserpentarium, where they fared well in spite of their prebirth baking.\n    Like their parents, our kids had the best of both worlds. Our first\nfriendships were with local year-round Mainers, but we eventually entered\nthe world of the summer folk who had been coming to Maine every year for\ngenerations. As a sailor, I joined the Kollegewidgwok Yacht Club. The club\nwas not fancy\u2014no bar, no restaurant, just a main building with a kitchen\nand bathroom, a little house for the manager and dock boys, another\nbuilding for the sailing instructors and their gear, docks and floats with gas\nand water and ice available for visiting cruisers\u2014and lots of moorings and\nlots of dinghies on the dinghy dock. Susan and I learned to play golf on the\ncountry club\u2019s beautiful little nine-hole course\u2014but we never got\n\fproficient, playing what we often called \u201cflog\u201d as we totaled up our scores,\nwith rare pars and bogeys but\u2014about once a summer\u2014an occasional\nbirdie. For the kids, these two worlds were negotiated with various ups and\ndowns. Some summer folk were regarded by them as detestable snobs, and\nthe next year they would be best friends while the townies were looked\ndown on, and the year after that they would switch allegiances again, but\nthere was a good amount of overlap between the groups, for both adults and\nchildren.", "location": 320204}

{"paragraph": "\u2026 Paris\nI\u2019ve lost track of how many times I\u2019ve been to Paris, as a speaker or as a\ntourist, and I\u2019ve already mentioned several adventures, but a few more were\nlife changing. In 1980, the Marxist philosopher Louis Althusser, a professor\nat the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure, strangled his wife. He was declared insane\nand institutionalized, leaving a position open at that most prestigious\ninstitution. For several years, his chair was vacant, and Jean Khalfa, then\none of my young philosopher fans in France (he\u2019s now at Trinity College,\nCambridge), managed to persuade his elder colleagues there that they\nshould give me a temporary visiting appointment while they continued their\nsearch for a permanent successor to Althusser. Needless to say, I accepted\nthe invitation, especially since its requirement that I lecture in French would\nforce me, finally, to achieve something approaching fluency in that\nlanguage. For some reason that escapes me now, my visit had to be\npostponed for a year, and when I arrived at the storied edifice in rue d\u2019Ulm\nin May 1985, Khalfa had left to take a position in Toulouse, and I had no\nnatural hosts to show me the ropes. No matter, I would give my French\nlectures, in Jacques Derrida\u2019s acoustically treacherous round stone well of a\nclassroom, to an audience that consisted of a few normaliens and a happy\nthrong of cognitive scientists and philosophers from other Paris institutions,\nwhose English was much, much better than my French, but I soldiered on\n\fgamely. I asked my official host, Bernard Pautrat, who attended my first\nlecture (only), for an assessment of my makeshift but enthusiastic French. It\nwas, he said, \u201cpittoresque mais tr\u00e8s clair.\u201d\n    Academic French tends to be quite arch and flowery, and I was not even\nattempting to create such elegant sentences. The Princeton philosopher\nRichard Rorty and I once attended a UNESCO conference in Paris where\nsimultaneous translation was provided and we both listened with the\nheadphones providing English to one ear and the other ear free to listen to\nthe French. The English translation was full of pauses along the lines of\n\u201cAnd so \u2026 I think \u2026 there are three \u2026 issues \u2026 that need addressing \u2026\ntoday \u2026 regarding \u2026 the challenges \u2026 facing democracy \u2026\u201d No content\nwas being lost in this gappy translation, and at one point Dick leaned over\nand whispered in my ear, \u201cThey think they\u2019re thinking.\u201d\n    The ENS may well have been embarrassed, or at least inconvenienced,\nby my presence, since nobody in the philosophy department there was\ninterested in cognitive science. They did nothing to advertise my lectures to\nother institutions in Paris. When Jean-Pierre Changeux, the silverback\namong French neuroscientists, learned of this, he wrote a ferocious letter to\nthem, after which their relations with me improved somewhat. For one\nthing, people who phoned to ask about the time and place of my lectures\nwere no longer told that the ENS knew nothing about them. This frosty\nreception didn\u2019t discourage me, since I was getting to know the gang at\nCREA, the Centre de recherche en \u00e9pist\u00e9mologie appliqu\u00e9e, where I later\nspent a happy few months in 1990, as well as the cognitive scientists at the\nCentre national de la recherche scientifique. Many of these researchers later\nformed the Institut Jean Nicod, where in 2001 I gave the Jean Nicod\nLectures.\n    French philosophers have been slow to develop any interest in my work\n\u2014aside from Pascal Engel, Jacques Bouveresse, Daniel Andler, and Pierre\nJacob\u2014but such cognitive neuroscientists as Changeux, Stanislas Dehaene,\nClaire Sergent, and others have more than filled that gap. I have been a\nfriendly critic (or contributor) to the Global Workspace model of\nconsciousness developed by them and Bernard Baars, the best articulation\nof something like my \u201cfame in the brain\u201d theory. When I published\n\fConsciousness Explained in 1991, I had lots of ideas, or at least hunches,\nabout how the cognitive architecture of consciousness would work, but I\ndidn\u2019t want to be prematurely dismissed if some of those hunches proved\nfalse, so I was deliberately noncommittal about a lot of details that have\nsince been falling into place rather well, thanks to their work and the work\nof others. So far, so good.\n   On another pet theme of mine, the role of Dawkins\u2019s memes in creating\nour minds, I have had a running debate for three decades with my best\nFrench critic, Dan Sperber, and some of his colleagues about cultural\nevolution. I once presented something of a pr\u00e9cis of my thinking on these\ntopics (in French) to a group of French phenomenologists who were\nstrangely defensive (and, I think, strangely offended) by my talk.\nPhilosopher/engineer Jean-Pierre Dupuy scolded the audience for their\nclosed-mindedness, and I said they reminded me of the wagon trains of\nsettlers heading west in America and pulling their wagons into a defensive\ncircle when they saw me coming. I told them not to worry: \u201cI\u2019m just\nmoving through your territory. Soon I will be on the horizon, and you\u2019ll be\nin danger of running out of water.\u201d", "location": 701795}

{"paragraph": "A  FTER THE 9/11 ATTACK ON THE   WORLD TRADE CENTER, I began to worry\nabout the rumbling of theocratic themes in America. It seemed to me that\nthe religious right was on a mission that jeopardized the separation of\nchurch and state. (And today, in 2022, my premonitions are confirmed.) I\nhad not had much to say about religion in my work, aside from deploring\nthe willful ignorance of creationists in Darwin\u2019s Dangerous Idea, a stand\nthat had marked me as an outspoken critic of fundamentalism and\nevangelicalism but not yet an \u201cenemy of religion.\u201d That changed in 2003,\nwhen Richard Dawkins sent me a draft of his op-ed piece for the Guardian\nintroducing the Brights, a movement founded by Paul Geisert and his wife,\nMynga Futrell, retired educators living in California. They were hoping to\nunify the various humanist/atheist/agnostic groups that were ineffectively\ntrying to influence public opinion, proposing a new term inspired by the\nsuccess of the term \u201cgay,\u201d which had become the mainstream term for male\nhomosexuals by then. Perhaps hijacking the positive word \u201cbright\u201d could\nplay a similar role in encouraging people to come out of the closet as\natheists or agnostics. The comparison was apt. In some parts of the United\nStates, a plumber or hardware store owner or hairdresser who admitted to\natheism would lose most of their customers overnight. And just as those\nwho aren\u2019t gay are called straight, not glum, those who aren\u2019t bright can be\ncalled super (because they believe in the supernatural), not dim. Are you a\nsuper or a bright? Two nice terms to identify with. Richard and I thought\n\fthis meme might spread if given some publicity, and I wrote an op-ed piece\nfor the New York Times that encouraged fellow humanists/atheists/agnostics\nto come out as brights\u2014if they could do it safely.\n   What had particularly energized me was a little experiment I ventured in\nSeattle, at the conference I mentioned at the beginning of this book, where\nexceptional high school students were gathered to hear short talks from\nscientists, artists, writers, and other successful people. At the end of my\ntalk, I announced that I was a bright and defined the term. The response was\nstunning. Many of the students came up to thank me, some with tears in\ntheir eyes. They had thought they were alone; they had never heard an adult\ncalmly express in public what they had figured out on their own. Seeing this\ntumult, several other speakers, including two Nobel laureates, mentioned in\npassing that they too were brights and got standing ovations from the\nstudents. Were we the silent majority? Perhaps; there were at least many\nmore of us than most people realized. Richard and I didn\u2019t manage to\nlaunch the term \u201cbright\u201d (so far\u2014\u201cgay\u201d took decades), but my op-ed in the\nNew York Times was the most shared opinion piece of the month. I got mail\nfrom all over the country imploring me to take advantage of the limelight\nand spread the gospel of the naturalist perspective.\n   I had no interest in writing a carefully argued case for atheism; it seemed\ntoo obvious to bother with. Others had done an admirable job over the\ncenturies, and I had nothing in particular to add. But I did think that the\nvery existence of organized religion was a peculiar phenomenon well worth\nscientific scrutiny. How had these strange superstitions managed to gain\nsuch a grip on our species for so long? I decided to write a book about the\nevolution\u2014both genetic and cultural\u2014of religious ideas and institutions.\nThe central theme would be one of Dawkins\u2019s most important insights in\nThe Selfish Gene: ideas were like viruses\u2014they had their own fitness, and\nan idea\u2014a meme\u2014could spread, like a pandemic, through a society\nwithout being good for those who adopted it. Many writers on religion\nargue that the success of religion shows that it improves the fitness of its\nadherents\u2014it helps build teamwork and allegiance and love of one\u2019s\ncompatriots, for instance, and a willingness to die for a cause. This is, no\ndoubt, part of the story, but it must be understood against a more clear-eyed,\n\fscientific background: evolution can foster nonadaptive habits, illusions,\nand even self-destructive projects under the right conditions.\n    Religion was born, according to my theory (which borrows heavily from\nresearchers in many disciplines), out of the chance juxtaposition of two\nimportant human adaptations with genetic bases: our agent-alarm systems\nand language. When something startles us, we tend to go into a state of\nheightened alert, and the question that naturally arises in our anxiety is not\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that!?\u201d but \u201cWho\u2019s there!?\u201d Is some predator or enemy approaching\nme? Maybe it\u2019s just a dead branch falling in the woods, or a wave\nscrambling the gravel on the shore\u2014but just in case, I should be on the\nlookout for an animate being who is taking an interest in me for one reason\nor another. This \u201corientation response\u201d is a common instinct in vertebrates,\nwell investigated in many species; in our species alone, it sets off a\nchurning group inquiry\u2014that\u2019s where language and information-sharing\ncome in\u2014that creates, in every human community ever studied, a\nmenagerie of elusive ghosts, fairies, ogres, leprechauns, sprites, and other\ncreatures of superstition. Only the most vivid and unforgettable fantasies\nsurvive in the evolutionary process that ensues. This is protoreligion,\npopulated by synanthropic memes, which evolve to thrive in human\ncompany, just the way squirrels, barn swallows, mice, and bedbugs do.\nOver time, some of these synanthropic species became domesticated. This\nhappens, as Darwin put it, when we human beings gain some control over\ntheir reproduction. These domesticated fantasies can then become our\npolitical beasts of burden, harnessed to control populations, keep the peace,\nand create loyalties that can survive great temptations. Organized religions,\nthen, are the culturally evolved systems of memes that arose naturally out\nof our innate vigilance and sociality. They have good features and bad\nfeatures, and we are now in a position to reverse engineer them. With\nscientific understanding, we have some hope of cleaning them up,\nmaintaining the good features and extinguishing the bad. Constructive\ncritics of religion have been trying to do this for centuries, of course, but\ntheir efforts have been hampered by one of the key adaptations of religion:\nthe taboo against looking too closely at how religions work and why. That\n\fis the spell that needs breaking if we are to avoid making terrible mistakes\nin the near future.\n    Richard and I decided not to exchange drafts of the books we wrote until\nthey were finished. His book, The God Delusion, and my book, Breaking\nthe Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon, appeared in 2006, and his\nwent on to be an international bestseller. Mine has done well but has had\nnothing remotely like the readership of Richard\u2019s book, or of Sam Harris\u2019s\nThe End of Faith (2004) or Christopher Hitchens\u2019s God Is Not Great\n(2007). The four of us got lumped together by somebody (not us) as the\nFour Horsemen of the New Atheism, and we adopted the term when we got\ntogether in Hitchens\u2019s apartment in Washington, DC, to record a lengthy\ndiscussion, which was meant to raise money for humanist and atheist\ngroups but soon was available for free on YouTube. (It is now also available\nas a book.)\n    In writing Breaking the Spell, I went out of my way to avoid giving\nreligious readers an excuse to throw my book across the room. I realized, as\nI was writing it, that I didn\u2019t know many deeply religious people and hence\ndidn\u2019t know how to write for them. I knew I would outrage many of them,\nbut I didn\u2019t want to offend them gratuitously, so I sought out folks who\nwere known by their friends and family to take their religion very seriously,\ndevoting their free time to their churches as sextons, Sunday-school\nteachers, choir directors, advisors, and so forth. I found about a dozen who\nwere willing to tell me with strict confidentiality their deepest views about\ntheir religion. This project may not have won me more readers, but it had an\nexcellent outcome. To my surprise I discovered that for most of them,\nbelieving the creed of their various faiths was not important. They didn\u2019t\nwant to discuss it and didn\u2019t think it mattered. Religion, for them, was about\ncommunity and tradition, about ritual and love, not doctrine. I believed\nthem, which is why my book devoted a scant six pages to arguments about\nthe existence of God, as one indignant critic noted.\n    I mentioned this discovery in the book, and after giving a talk in\nWashington I was approached by Linda LaScola, an expert qualitative\ninterviewer, who suggested that there were almost certainly ordained clergy\nwho felt the same way; perhaps we could find some to confide in us. This\n\fsounded like a good idea to me, and\u2014another lucky break\u2014Louis\nGodbout, a Canadian philosopher who was a fan of my work, got in touch\nwith me a few days later to tell me that he had come into some family\nmoney, that a charitable foundation had been set up, and did I (whom he\nhad never met) have any suggestions for projects? I unblushingly told him\nabout the proposed secret interviews, and soon his foundation approved a\nsmall grant for Linda\u2019s expenses so she could travel around the country\nmeeting clergy who wanted to use her as a confessor, furtively booking\nmotel rooms far enough away from their parishes that the chances of their\nbeing seen were minimal. How we located our first six closeted\nnonbelieving clergy is a long story (whose hero is Dan Barker, copresident\nof the Freedom from Religion Foundation and a former clergyman himself),\nbut after we published our first article about them in the Washington Post,\nsympathetically recounting what Linda had uncovered, we were flooded\nwith communications from further volunteer clergy who wanted to tell\nLinda their stories. Another small grant provided for another round of\ninterviews, which we eventually boiled down into a book, Caught in the\nPulpit, which Linda and I published first with Amazon in 2013 and then in\nan expanded edition with Pitchstone in 2015. When Sally Quinn published\nour original article on her Washington Post website, On Faith, she invited a\nvariety of major religious spokespeople to comment, and their angry\nresponses struck me as telling. They were not angry with Linda and me for\nfinding these closeted clergy and quoting their revelations; they were angry\nwith the clergy for spilling the beans! This was the fury of magicians when\none of their guild members reveals how a trick is done. None of the\ncommentators claimed that we were making this up or exaggerating; they\nknew that their own denominations were having a serious problem with\napostate clergy. And they knew it was getting worse.\n   In 2006, when I published Breaking the Spell, the rise of America\u2019s\nnonaffiliated\u2014the Nones, as they are called, confusingly, in survey\nsummaries\u2014was already underway, but in the fifteen years since then their\nnumbers have grown remarkably. The Nones are now in the majority,\naccording to a 2021 Gallup poll. I don\u2019t think the books by the Four\nHorsemen or the dozens of doubting demons who also published books\n\fcritical of organized religion in those years can take much of the credit for\nthis, but we certainly helped to open the floodgates. As I had realized when\nthose high school students expressed their joy with my self-outing in\nSeattle, just knowing that you are not the only doubter in town is a\nmultiplier of hope and activism.\n    I worked hard on Breaking the Spell, dropping all my other projects for\nseveral years of research and writing, and then doing a year or two of\nobligatory book maintenance after publication\u2014correcting\nmisrepresentations, defending against hostile critics, speaking at\nconventions and conferences. It was not a labor of love; it was a labor of\nobligation, and it cost me a lot in the ultimate currency of life: time. I spent\ntoo much precious time at conferences on the study of religion, for instance,\nwith diminishing returns\u2014and a few compensatory amusements. At one\nconference, I was challenged in discussion to provide an example of a\nubiquitous feature of human behavior that was not itself an adaptation\nenhancing genetic fitness. Masturbation, I replied, and this provoked a\nflurry of \u201ctheories\u201d by the would-be Darwinians to the effect that\nmasturbation must be practice lovemaking that improves reproductive\nbehavior, thereby making progeny more probable. The spell I especially\nwanted to break was the strong disincentive for smart people to work on the\nscientific study of religion, and I discovered that the spell, which is still\nhighly effective, consists largely of the fact that with a few fine exceptions,\nmost of the people working on the anthropology, sociology, psychology,\nand neuroscience of religion are fuzzy thinkers at best. If I wanted to\nprevent the probing study of some topic, I wouldn\u2019t try to prohibit such\nwork explicitly, or install cordons of red tape making access to the data\ntedious; I\u2019d just hire a lot of second-rate people to work on it, counting on\ntheir presence to drive away more incisive and imaginative investigators.\n    When I started on the project that led to Breaking the Spell, I was at the\ncutting edge of scientific work on consciousness and the brain, but research\nwas leaping ahead, and when I returned to these favorite topics of mine\nafter about a six-year absence, I had to play catch-up. Fortunately, I have\nhad my students and research associates at the Center for Cognitive Studies\nto help me with this reeducation, and more recently my role as one of the\n\fSenior Advisors to the outstanding CIFAR Azrieli program on Brain, Mind\nand Consciousness has kept me in touch with the leading researchers and\ntopics, so I\u2019m back on the edge, though it\u2019s a scramble keeping up with\nwhat\u2019s being learned and proposed. This is a great time to be thinking about\nconsciousness.\n    My follow-through activities for Breaking the Spell were largely a\ntedious chore, but I managed to maintain some enthusiasm for it, because\nthe issues were politically important, and it led to moments that were\nsometimes dramatic and sometimes amusing. On a right-wing radio show, I\nwas asked by an incredulous host how I could not believe in an all-powerful\nand ever-present Force without which Life would be impossible, and I\nreplied, \u201cBut I do, I do believe in such a force! \u2026 I call it \u2018gravity.\u2019 \u201d I went\non Al Jazeera in New York to explain my book and didn\u2019t immediately\nrecognize the other guest in the green room waiting to go on. I asked him\nhis name. \u201cAlan Dershowitz,\u201d he replied with visible annoyance. (That was\naccidental on my part, but it has since occurred to me to be an excellent\nploy to keep in your kit just in case you run into somebody who is a legend\nin his own mind.)\n    Breaking the Spell also prompted another of my consigned-to-the-file-\ndrawer experiments (see chapter 23) that may be of interest here. I had been\nimpressed by a pattern of polarization that could often be discerned when\nreligious conviction was under scrutiny, with the faithful doubling down\nwhen they felt threatened by inquiry, however polite, so I devised four\nquestionnaires, slightly different, which my postdocs and I randomly\ndistributed to several hundred university students (a significantly biased\nsample, as we now appreciate thanks to the work of Joseph Henrich and his\nteam). Two \u201cExternal\u201d questionnaires were phrased to suggest a somewhat\naggressive probe and hence to encourage defensive and exaggerated\nresponses; statements included Organized religion is not necessary to the\nmoral health of the nation and The hope of a reward in heaven is a childish\nand ignoble reason for doing good. Responses on a five-point scale ranged\nfrom \u201cstrongly agree\u201d through \u201cuncertain\u201d to \u201cstrongly disagree.\u201d The two\n\u201cInternal\u201d questionnaires were phrased to suggest a cooperative internal\ninquiry, and hence encourage candor and acknowledgment of doubt, if any.\n\fAmong those statements were Even the most devout people sometimes lose\ntheir faith and Science, for all the wonders it has discovered and will\ndiscover, will never take the place of religion. The questionnaires also\ndiffered in that the statements on half the External and half the Internal\nversions were prefaced by \u201cI believe.\u201d I believe Jesus walked on water and\nJesus walked on water seem on the face of it to be interchangeable in this\ncontext: if you strongly agree that Jesus walked on water you should\nstrongly agree that you believe Jesus walked on water and vice versa, but I\nsuspected that people would be more willing to \u201cstrongly agree\u201d that they\nbelieved this than to \u201cstrongly agree\u201d with the flat-out assertion. We didn\u2019t\nget any significant results from the questionnaires, in spite of expert\nstatistical hunting and sifting by my assistants. I had tried for a home run\u2014\nusing a small and subtle set of variants\u2014and had struck out. The data were\nlater discarded. Maybe better-designed experiments will either find the\neffects I was looking for or show that my hunch was just wrong. If anybody\nwants to pick up the issue and work on it, I can discuss our experimental\ndesign in more detail with them.\n    Before the book was published, people who thought they were in the\nknow pointedly warned me that my life would be in danger when it\nappeared; I\u2019d have to change my address and phone and make sure there\nwere plainclothes police present wherever I spoke. Mainly to assuage\nSusan\u2019s anxieties, I took this advice seriously. We began keeping a separate\nfile of \u201csuspect email and mail\u201d to hold the various venomous effusions\ngood Christians sent me, just in case they were ever needed in an\ninvestigation. Christopher Hitchens soon proved, however, that the religious\nright might make a lot of noise but didn\u2019t actually pose a physical danger.\nHe traveled all through the Bible Belt, giving talks that were much more\nincendiary than mine, and never worried about being assaulted.\n    I did get some alarmingly negative reactions, in spite of my efforts to be\nreasonable and\u2014you might say\u2014ecumenical. Leon Wieseltier wrote such a\nnakedly hostile review in the New York Times Book Review that they had to\npublish a separate section of objecting letters the next week. I received\ndozens of letters of support, but my favorite was from somebody I didn\u2019t\n\fknow, who asked me, \u201cWhatever did you do to him? Steal his wife? Rape\nhis daughter?\u201d\n    More obnoxious, in many ways, were the \u201cI\u2019m an atheist, but \u2026\u201d crowd,\nor the \u201cfaitheists\u201d (a good term coyned by Jerry Coyne), who claimed not to\nfind a need in themselves for religious belief but decried the rudeness with\nwhich we New Atheists imposed our skepticism on those who still needed a\nfantasy to live by. It never seems to occur to them how patronizing this\ncomplaint is: \u201cI, like you, see through all the smoke and mirrors, but come\non, guys, think of the poor dears who can\u2019t handle the truth!\u201d Then there\nwere the Liars for Christ, or faith-fibbers as I more politely call them,\nreligiously motivated folks who just could not avoid the temptation to lie\nwhen they told the world how evil and ignorant I am. Some of them are\nquite distinguished in their fields and would be merciless in their criticism\nof anybody who lied in defense of a scientific or historical question. (I have\nscolded a few in private, and a few have admitted their sins to me, so I have\npardoned them and won\u2019t rub it in by naming them here.)\n    When Susan read Caught in the Pulpit, she ventured that it might make a\nfine drama. Here were total strangers pouring out their hearts to Linda,\nrevealing secrets they had never told anyone\u2014not their spouses, not their\nchildren, and certainly not their clerical superiors. Another early reader who\nhad the same reaction was Marin Gazzaniga, the actor/dramatist daughter of\nmy old friend Michael Gazzaniga. She wanted to make a play based on the\ntranscripts of Linda\u2019s interviews. Since our research was under the auspices\nof Tufts University, we had to lead Marin through the Internal Review\nBoard vetting for researchers with human subjects so that she could look at\nthe transcripts. We got another grant\u2014this time from the Richard Dawkins\nFoundation for Reason and Science\u2014to support her writing, drawn\nverbatim from the transcripts. Lots of careful legal thinking went into\ndrafting abuse-proof permission forms that had to be signed by all the\nparticipants. An early version of the play was presented to Broadway\ninsiders in a professional reading, and scenes were dramatized for a Santa\nFe audience, before yet another draft was presented as a staged reading at\nPrinceton by the New York \u201cinvestigative theater\u201d troupe the Civilians.\nLinda and I had to form an LLC and get a Broadway lawyer. All I thought I\n\fknew about the production of plays I learned from the hilarious Mel Brooks\nfilm The Producers, and here I was playing the Zero Mostel role as best I\ncould, learning the lingo and trying to find deep-pocketed friends who\nwould invest. We acquired an executive producer, changed the name of the\nplay to Adam Mann (Not His Real Name), then changed it again, to The\nUnbelieving, which had a triumphant, sold-out four-week run in the fall of\n2022 with the Civilians at 59E59 Theater, in New York City. It had\nexcellent reviews in the New York Times and elsewhere and is now available\nfor further productions by regional repertory companies, colleges, and high\nschools.\n    Another happy sequel to my adventure in writing about nonbelieving\nclergy was the founding of the Clergy Project. This was started by a few of\nour early confidential interviewees and is devoted to the strictly private\nsupport of nonbelieving clergy (or former clergy). Linda and I helped found\nit but of course are not members, not being clergy or former clergy, and\nRichard Dawkins provided funding and technical support for their\nultrasecure website. With no advertising or canvassing, relying just on word\nof mouth, the Clergy Project now has over a thousand members, all current\nor former clergy. How many more secretly unbelieving clergy there are in\nAmerica is anybody\u2019s guess, but it wouldn\u2019t surprise me to learn that most\nclergy have not only experienced the \u201cdark night of the soul\u201d but emerged\ninto the daylight as quiet dissemblers, leading and comforting their flocks\nwhile keeping their matter-of-fact disbelief in the major tenets of their faiths\nto themselves. My impertinent hunch is that if you know a member of the\nclergy who is indefatigable in pastoral care and good works, you know\nsomeone who no longer believes the creed and is atoning for this spiritual\nfailing. Those clergy who still believe are those who are out playing golf.", "location": 608241}

{"paragraph": "T  HE  DENNETT FAMILY RETURNED TO OXFORD IN 1983 for the Trinity term so\nI could give the Locke Lectures in philosophy. A Locke Lecturer is almost\nalways from abroad\u2014most are from the US\u2014and gives a lecture a week for\nseven weeks. My topic was free will, and I discovered to my delight that\nRyle\u2019s masterpiece, The Concept of Mind, had originally been planned as a\nbook on free will. I like to think that Ryle, who died in 1976, would have\napproved of my lectures, which certainly bore the stamp of his enduring\ninfluence on my thinking. Where Ryle had exposed \u201cthe ghost in the\nmachine\u201d I exposed the \u201cbugbears\u201d that philosophers have resorted to in\ntheir forlorn efforts to motivate some of their pet themes, a phenomenon I\nhave recently called \u201cfree will inflation.\u201d\n   I brought with me my trusty Kaypro \u201cportable\u201d computer and a tiny dot-\nmatrix printer. Since my year with John McCarthy at CASBS, I was a\nconvert to both word processing and email, and I look back with mixed\nemotions on the joys and terrors of those early days of personal computing.\nThe early text-editing systems were actually faster, in general, than today\u2019s\nword processors, because they didn\u2019t have all the overhead of frequent\nautomatic copying and saving, and they weren\u2019t \u201cWYSIWYG\u201d (What You\nSee Is What You Get). You had to type in formatting codes: to get a phrase\n\flike \u201ca priori\u201d in italics, you had to type something like \u201c{CTRL\\ital: a\npriori}\u201d; it was not unusual to print out a file and find that you\u2019d forgotten\nto close off a curly bracket somewhere, with the result that page after page\nof text appeared in italics. Mildly annoying, but few calamities can match\nthe discovery that the file you\u2019ve labored over for weeks has disappeared\ninto the ether due to a computer malfunction, with no copies anywhere. The\nelaborate safeguards of today\u2019s operating systems are all welcome\nimprovements for which a few tedious milliseconds of delay are a price\nworth paying. One day I broke a spring on the little doorlatch of my Kaypro\nthat held the floppy disk for my operating system. If I couldn\u2019t close the\ndoor securely, I couldn\u2019t use the operating system at all, so I had to make a\nrepair. I took my ever-at-hand jackknife and whittled a specially shaped\nwedge out of a clothespin, which did the trick. Few philosophers in Oxford\nhad ever seen a personal computer then, and some of them came around to\nour flat to see the marvel; when they saw that I had actually repaired it\u2014\nwith a jackknife, no less\u2014they were unduly impressed with my computer\nexpertise, an opinion I didn\u2019t go out of my way to adjust.\n    I have written of the reception of my Locke Lectures, which were well\nattended, elsewhere. One of the Oxford philosophers in attendance, Michael\nDummett, was heard to say that he\u2019d be damned if he\u2019d learn anything from\nsomebody who could fill the seats in the Law Library week after week, and\ntrue to his word, he never learned anything from me. Meanwhile, Richard\nDawkins was sitting there every week, listening intently and often joining\nme for discussion and a drink afterward. A year later, I published my Locke\nLectures as Elbow Room: The Varieties of Free Will Worth Wanting, and it\nremains to this day my favorite book in many regards. As with my first\nbook, I insisted it be published simultaneously in hardback and paperback,\nbut this time the policy foundered. It was viewed as a textbook and got\nalmost no reviews. It was not as widely read, I think, as I had hoped and\nexpected. I have taken a certain satisfaction in watching many of the\narguments I advanced first in Elbow Room get either reinvented or\nmistakenly ignored by later philosophical authors. It\u2019s bad form to say \u201cI\ntold you so,\u201d but so help me, I did.\n\f    There were perhaps eighty philosophers on the faculty in Oxford at that\ntime, and a very select group, about a dozen of the most illustrious, met\nweekly during term for \u201cFreddie\u2019s Group,\u201d a predinner talk and drink with\nA. J. Ayer. That year I was invited to become a temporary member of\nFreddie\u2019s Group, and we met in Ronnie Dworkin\u2019s rooms in University\nCollege. I\u2019ve often wished I\u2019d had a discreet video camera\u2014they didn\u2019t\nexist then, of course\u2014to record the marvelous folkways of these\nphilosophers at that time. When the group had assembled, the speaker of the\nday would proceed to read their paper (of course), while the others listened\nintently, trying not to be distracted by the junior member present\n(Christopher Peacocke, then), who would tiptoe around the room to each\nmember in turn and whisper, \u201cWhat will you have to drink?\u201d and then go\noff to the bar to make a gin and tonic, or fetch a glass of wine or sherry\u2014or\nfor nondrinkers, like Derek Parfit, a glass of orange squash. After the\nreading of the paper, there would be time for perhaps forty-five minutes of\ndiscussion before the group went off to their respective colleges or homes\nfor dinner. I vividly remember Peter Strawson saying pointedly to another\nmember, \u201cI see you\u2019re holding the viva for Jones on Thursday. You know,\nhe really is a most virtuous fellow, most virtuous.\u201d \u201cAh yes, most virtuous,\u201d\ncame the reply, signaling receipt of the information that it would be a shame\nif Jones were not passed on his viva. Another time, Freddie was invited to\ndine with a member later in the week, and he checked his little pocket diary\nto see if he was free; he wasn\u2019t, but replied, \u201cI see I\u2019m down to dine in\ncollege that evening, but I shall un-dine myself and join you gladly.\u201d\n    I was invited to give a paper to Freddie\u2019s Group and chose a draft of my\npiece on the frame problem. All listened intently but then spent the first half\nhour of discussion arguing over whether or not it was, strictly speaking,\nphilosophy. I waited with mounting impatience and was grateful when\nDavid Wiggins, a philosopher\u2019s philosopher if ever there was one, broke in\nand said, \u201cWho cares if it\u2019s philosophy; it\u2019s a very interesting issue!\u201d A\ngood discussion then ensued. A curious fact that struck me recently was that\nin the nearly forty years since then, I have often given invited talks in\nOxford to the psychologists, to the biologists, to AI researchers, to student\ngroups, and at public occasions, but never to the philosophers. I have even\n\fbeen invited by the philosophy subfaculty to be on the committee to elect\nthe Wilde Reader (now Professor) of Mental Philosophy, but not to give a\ntalk. No matter; the philosophers whose work I admire have died or gone\nelsewhere in the meantime, and I still love my frequent returns to Oxford.\n    While we were in Oxford, I received an invitation from Robert Seyfarth,\nthe vervet monkey researcher I\u2019d met in Berlin, to join him and his wife,\nDorothy Cheney, in Amboseli National Park in Kenya for a few days of\nfieldwork, so I could get a better sense of the difficulties involved and\nperhaps help them design some further experiments. Susan, an expert\nexploiter of the British travel-agent industry, figured out that we could take\nthe kids with us for a two-week \u201choliday trip\u201d to Kenya, staying at the\nNyali Beach Club, a lovely old resort hotel on the Indian Ocean outside\nMombasa, and from there take a Land Rover camera safari to Amboseli,\nwhere I would be dropped off with Robert and Dorothy while she and the\nkids went back to the Nyali Beach Club to be joined by me at the end of our\nvisit. I proposed to write an article about my adventure in monkey research,\nwith lots of photographs, for Psychology Today, which provided partial\nfunding for the whole trip. Before I finished the article, the magazine, then\nowned by the American Psychological Association, ceased publication for a\nfew years, but I didn\u2019t have to refund the advance, and my article eventually\nappeared in Poetics Today, not one of my usual venues.\n    Robert and Dorothy\u2019s campsite base of operations in Amboseli, which\nthey shared with elephant researchers Cynthia Moss and Phyllis Lee, was\nlike a clich\u00e9 movie-set, with four or five large tents in a clearing, a small\ngenerator, an ingenious shower arrangement with an oil drum and sprinkler\nhead that could be heated over the wood fire and then hauled overhead with\na block and tackle, all presided over by Wasako, the friendly Kenyan cook\nand campsite manager, who kept snakes and buffalo and the like out of the\nlittle clearing. When we returned at sundown from a day in the field, after a\nwarm shower cold drinks would be ready in the living-room tent, a record\nwould be playing on a small portable phonograph, and a good meal would\nsoon be delivered to the table. Cynthia Moss was away, so I got to stay in\nher tent, which was surrounded by the skulls of elephants she had known\nfor years. I have described in detail what I learned and the ideas it provoked\n\fin my article, and I won\u2019t retell the tales here beyond noting one rather\nsideways discovery I made on that occasion: sometimes when you can\u2019t get\nan experiment to work the way you want it to work, that very fact is the\nkey. We were trying to figure out a way to assure ourselves that one\nmonkey knew something (the nearby presence of a [stuffed] python) and\nknew that another, rival monkey didn\u2019t know this. We were hoping to lure a\nmonkey into telling a lie, in effect. But we just couldn\u2019t arrange situations\nwhere this was a plausible reading of the epistemic conditions. Eventually it\ndawned on us that if we couldn\u2019t assure ourselves of this, neither could the\nvervets! Occasions to tell lies just can\u2019t arise when you\u2019re living in such\nclose quarters. Talleyrand once said that we were given language so we\ncould conceal our thoughts from one another, and if you can\u2019t tell lies\neffectively there is not much leverage to evolve language out of simple\nsignaling systems.\n   It\u2019s remarkable how quickly you can get used to novel circumstances.\nOne morning at breakfast we looked up and an elephant had pushed its way\nthrough the trees surrounding the clearing and was snacking on greenery\nunder the clothesline. We briefly took note and then went on with our\ndiscussion while the elephant finished its breakfast and disappeared back\ninto the trees. Before I joined Robert and Dorothy in their camp, we\nDennetts spent a night in the Amboseli Lodge, in one of the small\ncinderblock cabins that surrounded the eating hall and bar. There we\nencountered a different tribe of vervet monkeys, bold little thieves who\nwere not afraid of strange people and would grab crackers and peanuts off\nyour plate on the veranda when you weren\u2019t guarding them. The kids were\nshocked when a German woman tried to retrieve her peanuts from a vervet\nwho then bit her on the backside and sent her screaming into the restaurant.\nAround the outskirts of the houses, the management had laid out a line of\nwhitewashed boulders and warned all guests not to stray outside the\nboulders, where dangerous wild animals might attack us. We watched a\ngroup of tourists with their cameras walk right up to the boulder line, close\nbeyond which a dozen elephants were moving about. \u201cThe elephants don\u2019t\nknow the rules!\u201d came the anxious shout from one of the waiters, sending\nthe tourists back to their cabins in a hurry.\n\f    That evening some Maasai morans\u2014teenage boys preparing for their\ninitiation into manhood by killing a dangerous wild animal\u2014showed up at\nthe lodge, perhaps just to show off their amazing steel spears, beautifully\nfiled and polished, works of art with razor-sharp edges. The researchers\nwere trying with some success to persuade the Maasai not to go for\nelephants or rhinos but just for buffaloes or lions. Aside from the buffaloes,\nheavily armed Somali poachers looking for ivory or rhino horn were the\nmost dangerous mammals in the vicinity, and when we were in the field, we\nwere careful not to make any excursions that might inadvertently expose us\nto poachers. The Maasai, on the other hand, resented these interlopers and\nwould go out at night, barefoot and armed only with their spears and knives,\nand sneak up on poachers\u2019 campsites and kill them as they slept. One day a\nMaasai came to our camp and told Phyllis Lee that he had found a dead\nelephant not far away. Phyllis and I went to investigate, and she could of\ncourse recognize the animal from the ragged places on its ears and the other\nscars and bumps she used to identify her subjects. The tusks had been taken,\nand when we arrived at the spot the elephant was invisible under a blanket\nof vultures greedily feasting on the rotting corpse. I had to put a bandanna\naround my nose and mouth to keep from retching. What is it like to be a\nvulture? \u2026 say, eagerly climbing into the abdominal cavity of a long-dead\nelephant to retrieve some morsel?", "location": 457653}
{"paragraph": "Who had made Tati, and when? The shopkeeper had given me a little\nbook by Albert Ducrocq, a celebrated science presenter on French\ntelevision in the \u201960s. He had made and shown some simple robots and\nwritten about them, and she thought he might be the creator. Not a chance, I\nrealized, when I read the book. Tati was a confection conceived by an\nobsessive and imaginative tinkerer, with elements Rube Goldberg would\nhave admired. There was a timer composed of a series of bimetallic strips\nfrom thermostats; an electric current would heat them up one after another\nuntil a solenoid would turn on. The speed at which this happened was\nmodulated by a tiny electric fan, which could blow cooling air over the\nstrips to slow the process down. There were several motors, one of them\nfrom a Citro\u00ebn Deux Chevaux windshield wiper. A toggle switch of\nunknown function was Tati\u2019s epiglottis, and five small aluminum canisters\narrayed on his rump were simple light detectors that permitted Tati to be\ncontrolled by a flashlight. Tati perhaps had had a coat of some kind\noriginally, but he was more fascinating skinned, revealing hundreds of\nwires and switches cunningly packed into his body with tiny bolts holding it\nall together.\n\f    I posted some photos of Tati on my website, offering a reward for\ninformation about Tati\u2019s maker and history. I have received dozens of tips\nover the years, mostly suggesting that Tati is (a relative of) K9, the robotic\ndog in Doctor Who, the long-running British television series, but Tati\npredates K9 by some years. In 2001, just before I went to Paris to give the\nJean Nicod Lectures, I received an email, putatively from the beautiful\nFrench film star Sophie Duez, telling me that she knew Tati\u2019s history. It had\nbeen commissioned by Prince Louis de Broglie, the Nobel laureate\nphysicist, as a gift to his granddaughter in Paris. When the granddaughter\nfell on hard times, she sold it to the antique dealer. I asked for more\ninformation and Sophie said she was working on it. I replied that I would be\ngiving a series of lectures in Paris in a few months and would be happy to\nmeet her and learn more from her research, but then I began to receive\nemails from her with nude photographs of herself, and it became quite clear\nthat somebody was address-spoofing these emails, which were very likely\nnot from Sophie Duez, alas. I told my hosts in Paris all about this, and at\neach lecture I noticed them scanning the audience on the off chance that she\nmight make an appearance.\n    To throw some cold water on the de Broglie story: he was a bachelor, but\nmaybe he had a grandniece. Several diligent researchers have so far failed\nto uncover any more information about Tati, who was clearly made in\nFrance in the late \u201950s and will reside in some museum eventually.\n    With the help of Logo inventor and AI pioneer Seymour Papert, who\nlived down the road about a mile from our farm in Blue Hill, I attempted to\nreverse engineer Tati. This was a job requiring patience, a very delicate\nhand, and knowledge of circuit design. The chief problem was that Tati\u2019s\ncolor-coded wiring was so old and brittle that we didn\u2019t dare pull any of the\nwires out of their home terminals and had to resort to using dentists\u2019 mirrors\nand similar devices to peer noninvasively into Tati\u2019s interior. I searched for\nand eventually found sets of miniature metric socket wrenches we could use\nto loosen all the nuts and bolts. Tati is powered by two motorcycle batteries\nthat fit into a metal box on his backside, but we used a 12-volt converter\nplugged into house current to power Tati while we tested hundreds of\nhypotheses.\n\f    The dozens of switches made for a combinatorial explosion of\npossibilities, and although Seymour and I made some modest progress,\nmost of their functions remain unknown, in spite of a few tiny labels in\nFrench. I built a sort of rotisserie-spit stand in which we could clamp Tati so\nwe could turn him upside down without risking any damage, but we found\nit just as good to turn him over on an old sleeping bag on the dining room\ntable. There was an electric auto horn of sorts on Tati\u2019s underbelly, and we\nspent hours trying to short-circuit the wires to make it beep, but never found\nthe right connection of switches. Once, when we were getting Tati to roll\nacross the floor guided from behind by a flashlight, we heard an ominous\nclunk, and Tati stopped moving. Something\u2014a cam or connecting rod or\nsome gadget deep in Tati\u2019s interior\u2014had come loose and was the proverbial\nwrench in the works. Tati sat silently on our kitchen floor for several years,\nand my young grandson Brandon, about six years old, was fascinated by\nhim but did his best to follow my strict command that he look but not touch.\nOne day when I was up in my study, I heard him shout, \u201cGrampy, come\nquick! Tati\u2019s come alive!\u201d I rushed downstairs to discover Tati not moving\nbut going \u201cwoof, woof\u201d about every ten seconds. Brandon had somehow\nfound the sequence of toggle switches that turned on the auto horn. I tried\nshutting it off by more or less randomly hitting switches, but Tati kept on\nwoofing. I finally pulled a wire off one of the motorcycle batteries, and he\nhas been quiet ever since.", "location": 588039}

{"paragraph": "Tati\nA year or so before my Schlumberger jaunt, I gave a lecture in Paris, and\nwhile strolling around on the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9 I spotted a marvelous robotic\ndog in the window of an antique shop. It had a paper rose in its teeth, and it\nwas love at first sight. The shop specialized in antiques from the \u201950s\u2014\ngiant hairdryers and early MixMasters, for instance\u2014and I did my best to\ninquire about a number of different objets, not wanting to reveal my\nadoration for the doggie in the window. I did ask its price, which was out of\nmy range at the time (about $2,500), and I took the shopkeeper\u2019s card and\nleft. As soon as I got home, I called Oliver Strimpel, then the director of\nBoston\u2019s Computer Museum, where I had helped design a major exhibit, to\nsee if the museum would be interested in purchasing it or had any deep-\npocketed supporters who might be tempted to buy it and donate it. No, the\nmuseum, which was having financial difficulties, could not acquire\nanything (and soon closed, sad to say).\n    When I flew back to France to speak to Schlumberger\u2019s executives,\nequipped with my new Mac and demo software and with my handsome fee\nglowing in my mind, I resumed my quest. I had a free morning in\n\fVersailles, where the meeting was taking place in a grand hotel, and the\nSchlumberger person responsible for my care asked how I would like to\nspend the time. Would I like to be driven (by limousine, of course) into\nParis for some sightseeing? I pulled out the card and asked him to call the\nantique shop and ask if they still had a robotic dog for sale. He called the\nnumber, the shopkeeper answered, and after he discreetly asked the\nquestion she responded, \u201cAre you calling for the tall American with the\nbeard?\u201d So much for my poker face! But in fact my failure to cloak my\ndesire was the secret key to success. She and her husband had been inspired\nby my obvious interest and had taken the dog home and put it on their own\nhearth. But she would sell it to the lovestruck American with the beard at\nthe price she had given me. She would call her husband and have him bring\nit to the shop, so off we went to Paris in the limousine, which I asked to\npark around the corner, just in case she changed her mind about the price.\n    There was the doggie, just as I\u2019d remembered it. I wrote a check on the\nspot, and the shopkeeper promised she\u2019d send it to my hotel, all Bubble\nWrapped, by the next morning, well before my return flight to Boston. I\nnamed it Tati in honor of Jacques Tati, the great French comic filmmaker,\nwhose classic Mon Oncle (1958) satirizes the French enthusiasm for\nmodernistic design and gadgetry. Tati would have been a superb character\nin that gently comic film.\n    That night at the elegant dinner in the hotel, I was brought a telephone;\nthe lady from the shop was calling me. Uh-oh, I thought. Did my check\nbounce? But she was calling just to make sure that I wouldn\u2019t take Tati\napart, wouldn\u2019t destroy him for any reason; she too had fallen in love with\nthe dog and wanted to be sure he was going to a good home. I assured her I\nhad every intention of preserving Tati for posterity, and she expressed her\ngreat relief. The next morning, Tati arrived, with his carrying handle outside\nthe taped-up Bubble Wrap and a smile and eyes drawn on his wrapped face.\nWhen I got to the airport and checked in\u2014first-class, of course\u2014Tati went\nthrough the scanner and looked truly alarming in the X-ray image, with\nwires and switches and batteries showing. I figured I\u2019d have to unwrap the\nwhole thing and would never manage to get it neatly taped back up.\n\u201cQu\u2019est-ce que c\u2019est?\u201d asked the security guard. \u201cC\u2019est un chien\n\f\u00e9lectrom\u00e9canique,\u201d I replied stone-faced. \u201cInt\u00e9ressant,\u201d he said and waved\nme on.", "location": 584230}

{"paragraph": "More on Ryle\nIn 1961, Ved Mehta published a piece in The New Yorker about the\nbrouhaha in England occasioned by Ryle\u2019s public refusal to review Ernest\nGellner\u2019s book Words and Things (1959) in Mind, which he edited and\nwhich was one of the preeminent philosophy journals in the English-\nspeaking world. Gellner\u2019s book was a scathing polemic against ordinary-\nlanguage philosophy, and Ryle thought it was rudely disrespectful,\nespecially about his friend J. L. Austin, who was then dying. The letters\ncolumn in the Times of London had been full of argument about this, and\nRyle was still having to deal with the aftermath when I showed up in\nOxford. He told me that Bertrand Russell, who\u2019d written the foreword to\nGellner\u2019s book, sent him a note saying how foolish it had been to announce\nhis decision not to review it: \u201cWhat you should do in such a case is wait a\nyear or so and then publish a very brief critical review with the author\u2019s\nname misspelled.\u201d Ryle and Russell were never close friends, and Ryle told\nme that some years earlier he\u2019d found himself in a train compartment with\nRussell on a rather long trip to somewhere in Scotland, and Ryle had\nwracked his brains to think of a suitable topic of conversation. At length he\ntried, \u201cWhy do you think John Locke has been so influential, when he was\nneither as good a writer or thinker as Hume or Berkeley?\u201d Russell pondered\nfor a moment and said, \u201cIt is because John Locke invented common sense,\nand only Englishmen have ever had it since.\u201d\n    Most of Ryle\u2019s time when he was my advisor was spent editing Mind. He\nhated the American \u201cpublish or perish\u201d syndrome and did everything he\ncould to subvert it. He knew there were dozens of untenured philosophy\nprofessors in the US whose futures might well be secured by a single\npublication in Mind, so he gave special attention to submissions from\nAmerican assistant professors. If their essays were even halfway\npresentable, he\u2019d not only publish them\u2014without even sending them out\nfor further peer review\u2014but let them jump the queue of accepted articles by\n\festablished authors. There were papers by distinguished philosophers from\naround the world that languished in the limbo of \u201cforthcoming\u201d for years,\nwhile Ryle filled the pages of Mind with earnest but unseasoned efforts by\nyoung Americans. I made it a point of honor never to submit a paper to\nMind, until I read Jerry Fodor\u2019s The Language of Thought (1975) and sent\nRyle, unsolicited, a long review, or \u201cCritical Notice,\u201d at which point I\u2019d\nbeen tenured for half a dozen years.\n    Like most philosophers, Ryle was not a careful dresser, and one winter\nday I found myself standing behind him in the queue at Barclay\u2019s Bank,\nwaiting to cash a check (a cheque). He turned around and greeted me and I\nnoticed that his thermal underwear was pulled about halfway up over his\nwaistcoat. Quite a sight, and I struggled with whether it would be kind or\npolite to point this out to him. I decided not, which was probably the right\ndecision. His neighbor on the staircase in Magdalen was Jim Quitslund, one\nof my Harvard roommates, a Rhodes Scholar and excellent pianist. Jim\nknew who his eminent neighbor was from me, of course, and he decided to\nintroduce himself and ask Ryle if he would permit him to play his\nphonograph during the day and, if so, what preferences or dislikes in music\nhe had. Ryle said to Jim, \u201cPlay what you like, it\u2019s all the same to me. All\nmusic sounds like hail on a tin roof to me, and there\u2019s only two tunes I can\nrecognize: \u2018God Save the Queen\u2019 and \u2018Rule, Britannia!\u2019 and I can\u2019t tell the\ndifference between them, so I stand up for both!\u201d\n    Restaurants in Oxford in those days were in general terrible, but there\nwas one exception\u2014the fabled Restaurant Elizabeth in St. Aldates, across\nfrom Christ Church. Susan and I wanted to make a pilgrimage to this place,\nfamed for its wine cellar, one of the finest in England and maybe in all of\nEurope. We saved up our money and decided to celebrate handing in my\ndissertation (since I thought I might well not have anything else to celebrate\nbefore we left Oxford), and we invited Ryle to join us as our guest. The\nrestaurant was quite formal, and we discussed the meals we would order in\nhushed tones. What about wine? \u201cYou go ahead and order what you want;\nI\u2019ll make my own choice,\u201d Ryle said. So, we did, ordering a half bottle of\nChablis with the starter and a half bottle of reasonably priced Nuits-Saint-\nGeorges with our entr\u00e9es. When the waiter turned to Ryle and asked what\n\fhe would be drinking, he replied, \u201cI\u2019ll have a pint of bitter.\u201d The waiter\u2019s\nface fell. Probably nobody had ever ordered a pint of bitter (ale) in this\ntemple to wine. Stammering, he explained to Ryle that the meal he\u2019d\nordered had a rather rich wine sauce, and he couldn\u2019t recommend a\n[shudder] pint of bitter. \u201cThank you for your advice,\u201d Ryle replied, smiling,\n\u201cbut that is what I should like.\u201d The waiter excused himself and returned in\na minute with M. Lopez, the proprietor, shimmering in his white tie and\ntails.\n    \u201cThere seems to be a problem, sir?\u201d\n    \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Ryle replied. M. Lopez repeated the courteously\nworded advice his waiter had already offered, but Ryle wouldn\u2019t budge.\nFinally, with a look of deep sadness (or was it despair?), M. Lopez drew\nhimself up and firmly said, \u201cI am sorry, sir, but I am afraid the Restaurant\nElizabeth could not serve you a pint of bitter with that meal.\u201d\n    \u201cVery well,\u201d said Ryle, \u201cwhat do you have that goes with a pint of\nbitter?\u201d He ended up with some cold chicken and salad, and the waiter soon\nappeared with a pint of bitter, which he no doubt had had to run down the\nstreet and buy at one of the pubs.\n    Here is as good a spot as any to retell my oft-told tale of one of my\nadventures as president of the Voltaire Society. The logician Peter Geach\nand his wife, Elizabeth (\u201cMiss\u201d) Anscombe, lived about fifty yards down\nSt. John Street from our flat, and we often saw Peter walking by on his way\nto the railroad station. He taught at Leeds, but was much in evidence in\nOxford, along with his wife, who was a formidable force in philosophy, one\nof Wittgenstein\u2019s pupils and in fact one of his literary executors. I had\ntangled a few times in discussion with her, so I knew her, but I thought I\nwould ask Geach instead to give a talk to the Voltaire. I dropped by their\nhouse and Geach readily accepted my invitation. Who, I asked, might be a\ngood commentator? He didn\u2019t come up immediately with any names, but\nMiss Anscombe said, \u201cHow about Geoffrey Warnock, dear? Hasn\u2019t he\ndisagreed with you on some things?\u201d \u201cOh, I guess you\u2019re right,\u201d Geach\nreplied absently, so I went off to invite Geoffrey Warnock to respond,\ninnocently unaware that the Geach-Anscombes and the Warnocks were\nbarely on speaking terms. Warnock readily accepted, and I arranged for\n\fGeach\u2019s paper \u201cThe Perils of Pauline\u201d to be sent to him in advance so he\ncould write his reply.\n   The drill was that the speaker and commentator went to supper with the\nofficers of the Voltaire before the evening meeting, with the officers\nchipping in to pay for the guests\u2019 meals. I also invited Anscombe, of course\n(but not Mary Warnock) and, since it was my last evening as president of\nthe Voltaire, I had invited Ryle, whom I wanted to treat to a dinner. The\nprivate dining halls in the colleges we had used were all booked, so I had\nhad to scramble to find a restaurant that would take us all at a reasonable\nprice. I finally struck a deal with the owner of the Tackley Hotel in the High\nStreet, a Mr. Dennett (the first time I had ever met a Dennett who was not a\nclose relation). We agreed on sherry first with peanuts, a starter, a \u201cveal\u201d\ncutlet (it looked like a veal cutlet, but it would be pork chop disguised, as\nMrs. Dennett divulged, to the annoyance of Mr. Dennett), with potatoes,\nveg, and wine, and a cr\u00e8me caramel for \u201cpudding,\u201d all for the low price of\none guinea, service included, per person. A guinea was one pound, one\nshilling, and our number was thirteen, so I had put thirteen pounds, thirteen\nshillings carefully in an envelope before heading to the Tackley Hotel on\nthe appointed evening. The dinner went off without a hitch, with much good\nphilosophical conversation, but when the waiter brought me the bill it was\nfor more than fifteen pounds. Not wanting to make a scene, I excused\nmyself from the guests and went to the back room, where Mr. Dennett was\nat his desk. \u201cWe just couldn\u2019t do it for a guinea apiece,\u201d he said, smiling\nfaintly, and I handed him the envelope and told him that I was sorry he was\nlosing money on the dinner, but we\u2019d made a deal. I went back to the table,\nbut when we all got up to leave Mr. Dennett sent his waiters to give us the\nbum\u2019s rush, yelling at us and hastening us down the stairs to the street.\nWhat on earth was that all about? wondered Geach, Anscombe, Warnock,\nand Ryle. I explained, with the waiters still standing in the door of the hotel\nyelling at us and making rude gestures. Ryle turned to them as we began to\nwalk to Worcester College for the meeting and shook his fist at them,\ncalling out, \u201cMexican banditi!\u201d I doubt that they were Mexican, but they\nwere not English. That was the only time I ever heard Ryle make such a\nBlimpish remark, but it was duly provoked, and it pleased all in our party.\n\f    That would have been enough adventure for one evening, but there was\nmore to come. When we settled into our seats in our room at Worcester, I as\nhost sat in the middle on a long low sofa, with Geach on my right and\nWarnock on my left, with the audience and guests in chairs in front of us.\nGeach read his paper seated (as was the custom in those days), and I soon\nrealized that it was a thinly veiled attack on the late J. L. Austin, whom\nWarnock had deeply admired. You didn\u2019t say disrespectful things about\nAustin in Warnock\u2019s presence. I could hardly wait to hear Warnock\u2019s reply,\nand soon came the time for it. Warnock also sat, reading his commentary in\na quintessentially calm and superior Oxford tone, but he was throwing\ndaggers at Geach. Everybody was sitting on the edge of their chairs, and\nsuddenly I heard a loud slap to my right. I turned and saw that Geach had\nslapped his hands together and was shaking violently. I thought he was\nperhaps having an epileptic seizure. But he soon stopped shaking and began\nwriting furiously on his yellow lined pad. I looked over to see what he was\nwriting but couldn\u2019t make it out. It didn\u2019t seem to be in English. (I later\nlearned that Geach, who had trained with the Polish logicians, had the\ncurious idea that Polish was, in effect, the language of thought, and that\nwriting in Polish was a way to avoid confusion.) Warnock kept on calmly\nreading, elegantly launching a few more daggers as he went along, and\nsuddenly Geach jumped up from his seat on the sofa beside me and began\nswaying in front of Warnock. What should I do? I felt puny and helpless\nsitting there a few inches off the floor, but fortunately Miss Anscombe, who\nwas in the front row, issued a Psst! and beckoned him with a finger. He\nknelt by her chair and said, in a loud whisper, \u201cThis is impudence! I\u2019m\ngoing to call him out.\u201d She whispered back in his ear. A friend of mine\nsitting right behind her later told me that she said, \u201cNow Peter, be a good\nboy and sit down and wait for the discussion!\u201d which he dutifully did. After\nWarnock finished his intellectual surgery, it was time for a coffee break and\ncollecting dues; when we reassembled about ten minutes later, Ryle gave\nme the high sign to call on him, which I was happy to do. He thereupon\nbegan a leisurely and good-natured caricature of himself, piling example on\nexample, and benignly dissipating the fog of war, after which there was\nsimply no way for either Warnock or Geach to engage in phisticuffs.\n\f    Years later, having dinner with Warnock, who had become principal of\nmy old college, Hertford, I told him that I had been the callow (then\nbeardless) American quaking in between him and Geach at the Voltaire\nSociety back in 1964. What had he thought Geach was going to do when he\nwas swaying over him? Warnock said he\u2019d expected to be kicked hard in\nthe shins, but it wouldn\u2019t have stopped him from reading his paper. Is there\nanybody who can exhibit sangfroid better than an Oxford don?\n    Many philosophers still simply read their papers at meetings, forgoing\nthe high tech of PowerPoint just as they ignored the power of overhead\nprojectors before that. Once cognitive science got well underway in the\n1980s, I was often asked by perplexed psychologists, neuroscientists, and\nartificial-intelligence researchers why philosophers read their papers instead\nof just giving a talk with slides. I had an answer: when scientists give talks\nat a conference, they are talking about their work; when philosophers give\ntalks at a conference, that is their work, and all the care scientists take in the\nlaboratory to get things precisely right, with no sloppiness or chance of\nconfusion, is just like the care philosophers take when presenting their\nanalyses and arguments. I think this is a defensible support for the\nphilosophers\u2019 policy, but I also have to admit that many of them seem\nutterly oblivious to and uncaring about the intellectual discomfort they\ncause in their audiences, often reading dense and convoluted papers in a\nmonotone. Perhaps it is a philosopher\u2019s way of being macho: \u201cI dare you to\ncomprehend my paper on first hearing; it\u2019s way too subtle for lightweights\nlike you!\u201d\n    There have been many occasions over the years when I have been\nobliged to sit on a stage as part of a panel, listening to three or four talks,\nand I have sometimes found myself on the edge of sleep, my eyelids getting\nheavy, my concentration evaporating. It would be worse than rude to fall\nasleep during such an occasion, but how to avoid it? I have a system, and\nI\u2019ve shared it over the years with friends. It\u2019s the Mamie Eisenhower\nmethod, as I learned in Reader\u2019s Digest when I was a lad and Ike was\npresident. Mamie was asked by a reporter how she managed to stay so\nattentive when Ike was giving his stump speeches, all of which she had\nheard many times. She gave away her secret. She listened carefully for the\n\fletters of the alphabet in alphabetical order, thus: \u201cMy fellow Americans, I\nwant to talk about the actions and deeds of \u2026\u201d until she got to z and then\nstarted over. I tried it and found it worked beautifully, but I added some\nimprovements. I surreptitiously glanced at my watch before I started, and\nwrote down the time, and then to keep myself honest I wrote down each\nword as I got it. When I got to z, I would write down the time and start over.\nSo, my pad of paper would have something like this after perhaps twenty\nminutes:", "location": 164321}

{"paragraph": "W    HAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU WERE REFEREEING A        Paper Submitted to a\njournal and just as you finished writing your rejection report you realized\nthat a point the author made in passing had clarified your thinking on a\ntopic that had been evading you? It happened to me in 1990, when I was\none of the reviewers of a submission to the Journal of Cognitive\nNeuroscience. I didn\u2019t think the paper was up to the standards of the\njournal, nor could I think of any revisions to propose that would save it, but\nit had given me an idea that I wanted to acknowledge. How could I give\ncredit to an author of a paper that I didn\u2019t think should be published? I\ndecided to telephone the editor, my old friend Michael Gazzaniga, and ask\nhim for advice. He proposed a solution that strained the rules of the peer-\nreview system, but for a good cause: he gave me the telephone number of\nthe author and urged me to call him and talk it over, which I did. I explained\nto the author, Douglas Snyder, that I found his discussion of time and\nEinsteinian inertial frames applied to the brain suggestive, but I couldn\u2019t\nrecommend publishing his paper as it was. He was disappointed, of course,\nbut gracious, and he quickly replied that he had already published the idea\nthat had focused my own thinking in a paper (\u201cOn the Time of a Conscious\nPeripheral Sensation\u201d) in the Journal of Theoretical Biology. I could cite\nthat. You will find my citation of Snyder (1988) here of \u201cTime and the\nObserver,\u201d and in a grateful footnote here of Consciousness Explained. Was\nthat enough? I\u2019ve never been quite sure.\n\f    Writing Consciousness Explained was as intense a creative effort as I\nhave ever engaged in, and when I submitted the manuscript to my editor at\nLittle, Brown I could hardly believe I\u2019d produced it. That happened again\nwhen I finished Darwin\u2019s Dangerous Idea (1995). In both cases, I had often\nworked most of the way through the night in a frenzy of authorship that I\ncan now scarcely imagine. I still occasionally get brief bouts of that\nenthusiasm when I dig into a project, but without the all-consuming\nconcentration. I can\u2019t do all-nighters anymore; I\u2019ve lost a step or two.\n    My thinking about consciousness was evolving slowly, but always with a\ncentral theme. I was meeting often with leading scientific researchers on\nconsciousness, and in the process beginning to form at least vague ideas of\nhow mechanisms of the brain might do all the work, but only if we deflated\nsome of the overconfident pronouncements of introspectors about the\nmarvels of the phenomena. Discussions with Jean-Pierre Changeux and\nStan Dehaene in Paris about the \u201cglobal workspace model\u201d of Bernard\nBaars; with Larry Weiskrantz, Alan Cowey, Edmund Rolls, and Jeffrey\nGray at Oxford; and with the Lake Como gang assembled by Marcel and\nBisiach supplemented my discussions with our little group. Humphrey,\nKinsbourne, and Jackendoff were all improving my amateur grip on\nneuroscience. Looking back, I can see my growing conviction that although\nconsciousness is a spectacular phenomenon, it isn\u2019t as wonderful as many\npeople liked to think. There is a strong tendency to \u201cprotect\u201d consciousness\nfrom scientific investigation, exaggerating its mysteries and heaping\nsuspicion on any proposals that threaten to uncover some of nature\u2019s cheap\ntricks.\n    Many people want consciousness to be \u201creal magic\u201d (as Lee Siegel puts\nit; see the prologue, p. xx), not a bunch of tricks. This yearning is revealed\nin the popularity of the standard put-down of Consciousness Explained: that\nits title should be Consciousness Ignored or Consciousness Denied or\nConsciousness Explained Away. This is a convenient way for critics to\nreassure their readers that they are on the \u201cright side,\u201d defending the sacred\ncitadel from the barbarian defilers, without having to demonstrate any\nactual errors in my account. In the book, I developed the powerful idea of\nvirtual machines in the brain as creators of user illusions and then\n\fconfronted the obvious question: \u201cIf consciousness is a virtual machine,\nwho is the user for whom the user illusion works?\u201d (p. 219). I added that \u201cit\nlooks suspiciously as if we are drifting inexorably back to an internal\nCartesian Self, sitting at the cortical workstation and reacting to the user\nillusion of the software running there, but there are, as we shall see, some\nways of escaping that dreadful d\u00e9nouement.\u201d\n    Those escape routes are all-important, obviously, and I devoted many\npages to clarifying them, but it is striking how few of my critics have ever\ndiscussed them. These critics would rather characterize my book as an\nidiotic denial of an obvious fact: consciousness can\u2019t be an illusion, because\nthere can\u2019t be an illusion without a victim\u2014the conscious agent whose\nillusion it is. The philosopher Galen Strawson has called my theory \u201cthe\nsilliest claim ever made,\u201d a verdict that ought to arouse a little suspicion in\nhim that he\u2019s misinterpreted me, but he has persisted undaunted. It is\napparently just unthinkable by Strawson that he might be an unreliable\njudge of what his own consciousness is. Oxford-trained philosophers of my\nvintage have a move they like to use when confronting a view that they\ncan\u2019t figure out how to refute: simply say, with an air of feigned modesty, \u201cI\njust don\u2019t understand what you could mean by that,\u201d insinuating that what\nyou had said was utter nonsense. Another Oxford-trained mysterian,\ncommenting on my book at an APA meeting, once said that he just\n\u201ccouldn\u2019t understand\u201d a claim in the book. My response on that occasion\nwas to grant that my book had some difficult passages in it, and I advised\nhim to try harder. I sometimes can\u2019t resist the urge to be rude in response to\nrude critics.\n    Encouraged more recently by some insightful papers by Keith Frankish,\nI have strengthened my account, endorsing his term \u201cillusionism\u201d as a good\n\u201cism\u201d-label for my view. This has provoked another wave of disapproval\nfrom some of my constructive critics, who think my theory is basically on\nthe right track but is unwisely burdened with such a disturbing name. They\nmay in the end be right about my expository decision, but I\u2019m not\nconvinced yet. Probably the younger generations of thinkers who have\ngrown up with video games and smartphone apps find it easier to recognize\nuser illusions as good things\u2014helpful oversimplifications with\n\fbeneficiaries, not victims. Given canny theorists like Chris Frith and Anil\nSeth adopting the idea of conscious experience as \u201ccontrolled\nhallucination,\u201d while acknowledging with me that there is no movie in the\nhead, and Michael Graziano and others pursuing similar themes, I think the\ndeflationary account of consciousness as a marvelous bag of good tricks,\nnot \u201creal magic,\u201d is in better shape than ever, gathering both empirical\nsupport and sophisticated adherents as it grows.\n    Suppose you were a relatively unknown neuroscientist whose\nexperimental work was suddenly hailed by a Nobel laureate neuroscientist\nas being the first ever scientific demonstration of dualism. Benjamin Libet\nwas faced with a Faustian bargain when Sir John Eccles trumpeted his\nendorsement, saying that Libet had uncovered a phenomenon that \u201cdoes not\nseem to be explicable by any neurophysiological process.\u201d For years, Libet\nstruggled to find a way of interpreting his work as revolutionary, if not quite\nthe vindication of dualism that Eccles claimed it to be. I first learned of\nLibet\u2019s work in 1979, when reviewing Popper and Eccles\u2019s notorious book.\nI alerted Pat Churchland to the work and suggested she could make\nmincemeat of it, which she promptly did, sparring with Libet in a\nmemorable exchange (and also incurring Eccles\u2019s wrath). In the intervening\nyears, Libet\u2019s work has been voluminously critiqued, interpreted, defended,\nand dismissed, and a curious feature of that discussion is that almost\nnobody draws attention to the embarrassing fact that Libet did two kinds of\nexperiments. His early experiments on awake (non-anesthetized) brain-\nsurgery patients\u2019 reports about the timing of sensations undercut all\n\u201crevolutionary\u201d interpretations of his later experiments on consciousness of\nintentions. I had pointed all this out in a long and difficult section of my\nbook (pp. 153\u201366), a critique that has been conveniently swept under the\nrug (using Occam\u2019s broom) by those who want to use Libet\u2019s later work to\n\u201cdisprove\u201d free will. (I tried to dispose of Libet\u2019s work in a more accessible\nfashion in Freedom Evolves [2003], but that exploration has largely been\nignored. Either I\u2019ve always been just wrong about Libet, or my critiques are\nunwelcome guests at the philosophers\u2019 parties where the mysteries of\nconsciousness and free will are debated. Time will tell.)\n\f   Consciousness Explained was not my first trade book (that would be The\nMind\u2019s I, coedited with Doug Hofstadter), but it was my first book where I\nwas represented by an agent. Several colleagues in fields other than\nphilosophy had encouraged me to get an agent, saying that my style was\naccessible to a much wider audience than I would find if I continued to\npublish with university presses, and to publish with a trade house I\u2019d best\nhave an agent. I had by then diagnosed a major flaw in interdisciplinary\ncommunication: when experts write for experts, they always err on the side\nof underexplaining, in order to avoid insulting their colleagues with\noverexplaining. The only practical cure for this systematic and\nunderstandable failure was to write for an audience of \u201ceducated laypeople\u201d\nand let the experts eavesdrop without being insulted. I\u2019ve described this\nstrategy in Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking (2013).\nConsciousness Explained was my first deliberate test of it. If the book had\nbecome a runaway bestseller but not engaged my academic colleagues, it\nwould have been a failure in my eyes. The educated laypeople were my\ndecoys; I hoped they would understand it, and I worked hard to convey my\nideas vividly and directly, but it was my colleagues, especially the\nscientists, whom I wanted to reach. It worked. Glowing reviews by George\nJohnson in the New York Times Book Review and Philip Morrison in\nScientific American certainly helped, and \u201cTime and the Observer\u201d in\nBehavioral and Brain Sciences convinced many scientists that I wasn\u2019t just\na science journalist/philosopher but a theorist worth their attention.\n   A lot of the credit for the success of the book should go to John\nBrockman, the legendary literary agent who courted me for months before I\ntook the plunge. His stable of clients then included a few friends of mine\u2014\nBill Calvin and the AI theorist Roger Schank, who encouraged me to sign\nwith him\u2014but also a few authors of pop-psychology and pop-physics\nbooks I would never recommend or cite. What finally won me over was\nBrockman\u2019s canny observations about the financial aspects of publishing. If\nhe could get me a big advance, the publisher would want to recoup its\ninvestment by vigorously pushing for reviews in top periodicals and shelf\nspace in the big bookstore chains of the day. Moreover, they would want to\nkeep the price of the book as low as possible, unlike university presses,\n\fwhich were then charging outrageous amounts for their monographs, a\npractice that still continues in spite of much criticism. I wanted my book to\nbe affordable by students and to include illustrations\u2014line drawings and\ndiagrams\u2014which would make a university press book even more\nexpensive. Brockman said he could more or less guarantee a follow-up\npaperback version within a year of publication of the hardback. He was\nright on all counts. And, I might add, trade publishers do a much more\nvigorous job of copyediting and fact-checking than university presses. I\nsoon learned the value of a truly professional copyeditor. Mistakes still\ncreep into my books, but conscientious editors have saved me from a lot of\ncareless errors, in addition to fearlessly objecting to occasional lazy phrases\nand convoluted sentences, which I gratefully and red-facedly repaired.", "location": 513916}
{"paragraph": "\u2026 London\n\fIn 2001 I was a Leverhulme Visiting Professor at the London School of\nEconomics, which gave Susan and me our first opportunity to live in\nLondon for an extended period instead of staying in hotels or making day\ntrips from elsewhere in England. We found a furnished apartment near\nEarl\u2019s Court, in the building where Diana Spencer lived before she married\nPrince Charles. There was a pleasant interior garden courtyard and good\narchitectural details. My daily Tube trips to LSE and back were an\ninteresting routine, and the best students at LSE were excellent. I did a\nseminar on free will, which led up to my 2003 book, Freedom Evolves. This\nwas at a time when the UK was trying out a new scheme of quality\nassessment, tracking publications in peer-reviewed journals, and I learned\nto my amusement that one of the reasons I was invited to be a visiting\nprofessor was that the philosophy department at LSE got to list all my\ncurrent publications in their record of accomplishments! It is more than\ndifficult to measure academic achievement, and Goodhart\u2019s law rules:\nwhenever a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.\nLSE\u2019s philosophers were very productive but not above salting the mine\nwith a few extra nuggets.\n    In 2013, I was invited to be on the faculty of the New College of the\nHumanities in London, philosopher Anthony Grayling\u2019s brave experiment\nin a private college\u2014much like Tufts and so many famous colleges in the\nUS\u2014in a country that has frowned on the concept. Once I was assured that,\njust as at Tufts, there would be scholarship funding for worthy students who\ncouldn\u2019t afford the tuition, I joined the faculty with the expectation that I\nwould spend at least a week a year teaching there. There was an initial\noutcry among academics in the humanities in London against Grayling\u2019s\nproposal, partly inspired, I soon learned, by the fact that Grayling was\nluring excellent young people away from other London university\ndepartments with his better salaries and working conditions. \u201cHow could\nyou agree to do this?\u201d I was asked angrily by philosophy professors and\ngraduate students in London, but I defended my decision; NCH, like Tufts,\nwas privately funded, academically elite (like Oxbridge colleges), but not\nreserved for the rich. It had been arranged that NCH students would take\n\fthe University of London examinations for their degrees, and the first proof\nof concept came in 2016, when NCH students were at the top of the listings.\n    NCH has been my London academic home now for almost a decade, and\nonce COVID is firmly in retreat I hope to go back for some more lectures\nand seminars. Coming to London for a few weeks at a time is a great way of\ngetting together with the dozens of academics in several fields whose work\nis of importance to me, and my dance card is always full when I\u2019m in town,\nbut we make sure to reserve some time for theater and music, going to Tom\nStoppard\u2019s The Hard Problem as his guest one night, and David\nBenedictus\u2019s play, The Happy Hypocrite, based on a story by Max\nBeerbohm, on another.", "location": 698686}

{"paragraph": "Our neighbor to the south was Stetson\u2014Stet\u2014Grindle, a grizzled tall-\ntale-telling character who had once been made sheriff of Blue Hill on the\ntheory that it might keep him out of trouble. It didn\u2019t quite, but he was a\nlovable and friendly character, and he filled in many details\u2014some of them\nbelievable\u2014that Basil never got around to. His brother Newton Grindle\nlived down along the coast and had a sailboat, the Dancing Dolphin, that he\nand his wife Leila would go out in quite often in the summer when their\nfarm chores were done. Newton was the man who smoked your hams and\nbacon slabs when you slaughtered a pig, and he used to tease me, calling\nme the \u201cupland sailor\u201d because he had a sailboat and I didn\u2019t (aside from\nJerry Fodor\u2019s boat, which was only for a few years). We bought our son\nPeter a Mercury\u2014a small keel sloop that was raced by the kids in Blue Hill\n\u2014and one day I was out in it in a light and variable wind and made a big\neffort to pass Newt and Leila in their boat on the way back into the harbor,\n\fonly to realize when I passed close by that the reason I was \u201cbeating\u201d him\nwas that he and Leila had mackerel jigs trailing and wanted to go slow. He\ngot a kick out of that. One time Stet shot a bear and promised me a bear\nsteak from his freezer, which I was looking forward to cooking until his son\nJames said to me, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t cook that indoors, if I was you.\u201d Since the\naroma in Stet\u2019s kitchen was a strong combination of wood-stove smoke and\nbaked beans and who knows what else, I took James\u2019s advice seriously, but\nI never got to cook bear steak. A storm knocked out the electricity on our\nroad, and all the meat in Stet\u2019s freezer was spoiled. Stet was very interested\nin the cider-making operation we lovingly pursued for decades, turning it\ninto Normandy cidre bouch\u00e9, natural champagne. One time, I took my\nwine-making partner and friend Barry Lydgate, a Wellesley French\nprofessor who was deeply involved in wine (a Chevalier du Tastevin, and\nmember of La Confr\u00e9rie de la Cha\u00eene des R\u00f4tisseurs), down to Stet\u2019s house\nto share a little of our latest cider with him. Stet savored the glass we\noffered and then told us how it was almost as good as the hard cider his\nfather Roy had made years before: \u201cI tell you, that was some good! Half a\ntumbler of that would make your whole face go numb!\u201d Barry salted that\nline away, vowing to use it at a snooty wine tasting where he could repeat it\nafter sipping some posh vintage. He says he has done it more than once.\n    One day on our first year or so at the farm, Stet drove by on his tractor\nand found Susan and me bathing at one of the dug wells in our backyard\n(we hadn\u2019t built a bathroom yet), and he asked, \u201cYou ain\u2019t drinkin\u2019 that\nwater are you?\u201d I said no, not as a rule, but it seemed very clear and\ndrinkable.\n    \u201cI shouldn\u2019t drink that if I was you.\u201d\n    \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n    \u201cWell, \u2026 there was a barn there years ago, and lots of manure got\nshoveled out there.\u201d\n    \u201cYes, but that was more than thirty years ago. No trace of it now.\u201d\n    \u201cWell, \u2026 still I\u2019d say don\u2019t drink it.\u201d\n    \u201cBut why not?\u201d\n    \u201cWell, I tell ya \u2026 A year or so ago, some fellers poached a deer in your\nback field and stuffed the entrails down your well!\u201d We didn\u2019t ask Stet how\n\fhe knew this, and we had the water tested. It was fine.\n   In all our summers at the farm, I did hardly any academic work\u2014until\nemail came along. I\u2019d get a big manila envelope of forwarded mail from my\noffice at Tufts about once a week and deal with it, and I\u2019d read a book or\ntwo over the summer, but I didn\u2019t spend hours at my typewriter or, later, my\nlaptop. I was too busy with farm projects, canoeing, windsurfing, crewing\non various sailboats, exploring Maine. By September it felt like I\u2019d\nforgotten all the philosophy I ever learned, but I was rarin\u2019 to go, full of\nideas for how to teach my courses, ideas that had popped into my head\nwhile I was mowing hay or painting the barn door or engaged in some other\nmore or less routine task.

I\u2019d spend twenty minutes at my\ndesk, packing my head with a philosophical problem that had been puzzling\nme, and then go out and hop on the tractor and as often as not have a\nbreakthrough before I came in for lunch or supper.\n\f                               Stetson Grindle", "location": 307464}

{"paragraph": "IN THE SPRING OF 1976, I WAS INVITED BY OSWALDO Chateaubriand to give a\ntalk to the philosophy department at Vassar, and as I made the long drive\ndown the Mass Pike from Tufts to Vassar I got to musing about a thought\nexperiment: if somehow my brain were moved into my chest cavity without\ndestroying any connectivity, wouldn\u2019t I still think my mind was right behind\nmy eyes and between my ears? This morphed into a more elaborate thought\nexperiment, with my brain removed from my head and kept alive in a vat,\nwhile connected to my body by radio links. By the time I got to\nPoughkeepsie I had concocted quite a tale. After my talk (on another topic\n\u2014I can\u2019t remember what), Oswaldo invited me and a group of Vassar\nstudents to his house for wine and cheese, and there I decided to try out my\ntale on them. The students were rapt and full of questions, and before the\nevening was over many more details had fallen into place. I knew then what\ntalk I would give as the Saturday after-dinner speaker at the University of\nNorth Carolina\u2019s renowned Chapel Hill Colloquium in October. This annual\ngathering had long been the occasion of memorable philosophical events. In\n1971 I had been the commentator on Thomas Nagel\u2019s then-unpublished\npiece \u201cWhat Is It Like to Be a Bat?\u201d My response was titled \u201cWhat Is It\nLike for There to Be Something It Is Like to Be Something?\u201d and UNC\u2019s\nJay Rosenberg, clad in a flamboyant cape, opened the discussion by telling\nus in a thick Transylvanian accent what it was like to be a bat part of the\ntime.\n\f   The after-dinner talk was by tradition lighthearted, but still having some\nphilosophical substance to go with dessert. \u201cWhere Am I?\u201d was the title I\nhad given UNC to print in the program in 1976, and one philosopher asked\nme at cocktails what it would be about. \u201cPersonal location,\u201d I deadpanned,\nand he nodded sagely as if he now had a clear understanding of my topic.\nMy purportedly autobiographical story needed a prop, a toggle switch to be\nthrown at the end of the talk to switch control of my body from my brain to\na computer copy of my brain, and I had purchased a small metal box to\nwhich I had attached a telescoping radio antenna and a toggle switch. I\npulled this contraption out of a paper bag at the end of my talk, threw the\nswitch, and ad-libbed the rest of the talk, supposedly under the control of\nthe copied brain\u2014or had my speaking been controlled by the copied brain\nuntil now? An effect I hadn\u2019t anticipated heightened the drama. I had read\nmy paper up until that moment, as philosophers then always did, but it was\nimportant to the story that I simply speak, dramatically, after the switch was\nthrown. The slight differences between my reading voice and my\nimpromptu speaking voice produced an uncanny sense in many in the\naudience that they were indeed now listening to a different person, a clone\nof sorts of the Dan Dennett who had read the paper. The place went wild.\n   Word soon spread about my performance, and I was besieged by\ninvitations to give it again, but I accepted only one: from MIT. The effects\nthat rippled out from that evening nevertheless changed my life in some\nfundamental ways. Robin Brightwell of the BBC was making a\ndocumentary about the mind and brain and wanted me to undercut some of\nthe nonsense that Sir John Eccles had uttered in his interview (more on\nEccles later). I participated in a dichotic-listening experiment (to give my\ninclusion in the program a little scientific gloss) and then enacted the key\nscene from my story, where I look at my brain in its life-support vat and\nwonder why I\u2019m thinking \u201cHere I am, looking at my own brain\u201d and not\n\u201cHere I am, floating in a vat being stared at by my own eyes.\u201d The BBC\nhad designed and built a fabulous brain-in-the-vat set, with whirring tape\ndrives and blinking mainframe lights in the background (what a computer\nlooked like back then), but Robin realized that he also had to do something\nto make it clear that this was a dramatized thought experiment, not a real\n\fexperiment. It wouldn\u2019t do if, the morning after transmission, half a million\nBrits thought a living American philosopher had had his brain removed!", "location": 290625}

Quine was famous for his dictum \u201cTo be is to\nbe the value of a bound variable,\u201d which means, roughly, that if your theory\nrequires you to talk about \u201call the x\u2019s that are F\u201d or \u201cThere is an x that is F,\u201d\nthen your theory is committed to the existence of x\u2019s that are F. But if you\ncan find a suitable paraphrase, you don\u2019t have to commit yourself to these\nthings. Quine\u2019s efforts to slim down his ontology were influential, but\nembattled. When someone once quoted to him Shakespeare\u2019s line \u201cThere\nare more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your\nphilosophy,\u201d Quine is said to have responded: \u201cPossibly, but my concern is\nthat there not be more things in my philosophy than are in heaven and\nearth.\u201d\n    If that\u2019s what the verb \u201cto quine\u201d meant, what was a \u201chintikka\u201d or a\n\u201ccarnap\u201d? What did the adjective \u201cbewilfrid\u201d [Sellars] mean, and what was\nit \u201cto ryle\u201d?

I told this to Carolyn and extracted a promise from\nher. She wouldn\u2019t kill herself until she had read Nagel\u2019s piece, which was\nalready published, and Albritton\u2019s response, and then talked it all over with\n\fme. She agreed. Albritton had moved to UCLA by then, but I got his phone\nnumber from the Harvard philosophy department and gave him a call:\n    \u201cHello, Rogers, it\u2019s Dan Dennett, at Tufts.

Could we perhaps recreate\nmuch of it right now, at least the main points? You were there and must\nremember some of it pretty well.\u201d\n    We spent a long-distance hour or so going over our recollections, while I\nscribbled notes, and when we ran dry, I thanked him and hung up. I had my\nmeeting with Carolyn a few days later, and so far as I know, she got over\nher depression and carried on, though I soon lost track of her. (Carolyn, if\nyou are still alive and you read this, please get in touch with me.)\n    It was only after I\u2019d hung up the phone with Rogers that it hit me that he\nmust have thought it was I who was suicidal and that I had been calling his\nbluff, recreating the opening scene of his commentary. That must have been\non his mind as he hung in there and helped the \u201cacquaintance, not a close\nfriend.\u201d Six months or so later, I ran into him at a cocktail party at the APA\nannual meeting and assured him that I really did have a suicidal student,\nand that he\u2019d been a wonderful help to her. His eyes widened. \u201cOh Dan!\u201d he\nexclaimed. \u201cIt never occurred to me that it was you, Dan, you who were\nthinking of suicide! I feel terrible.\u201d\n    \u201cNo, Rogers, it wasn\u2019t me. It was her, and you did great!\u201d\n    An MA student at Tufts many years ago who had been an undergraduate\nat Harvard some years earlier was clearly having serious mental problems,\njudging by his behavior in my seminar. I was on the verge of trying to get\nhim to walk with me down to the Tufts psychiatrist\u2019s office when he\n\fsuddenly withdrew and disappeared. A few months later, he called me up to\ntell me that he\u2019d just made a remarkable discovery: There had been a\nbeautiful but unapproachable girl at Harvard when he was there, and he\u2019d\njust discovered her in a Cambridge supermarket. She had been dressed like\na whore. She hadn\u2019t seen him, but he\u2019d surreptitiously followed her home,\nso he knew where she lived. He gave me her name and address and told me\nhe was going to pay her a visit. Uh-oh. What should I do? As it happened,\nhe had been at Harvard when a friend of mine was also a student there, and\nI immediately called my friend up and asked if he knew a girl by that name.\nOh yes, she was the most beautiful girl at Radcliffe then, and many had\nbeen smitten by her, all unrequited love so far as he knew. Now I was\nseriously worried. I looked up her name in the Cambridge telephone book,\nand there it was, along with the address I had been told. With a shaking\nhand, I dialed the number, fearing that my former student would answer and\nsay something like, \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you to call me here. What took\nyou so long?\u201d But instead, a nice old lady answered, and I asked if she was\nXY, and she said yes, she was. I said I was looking for an old friend with\nthe same name and asked if she had a daughter or granddaughter by the\nsame name living with her. No, she was childless and living alone. So, I\nfigured it out: my student, still obsessed with this young woman, had\nsimply looked in the phone book and found the name and address, just as I\nhad. If he ever did go to her door, which I doubted he would do, he would\ndiscover his error and leave without incident. I thought my keeping all this\nto myself was better than filling the nice old lady\u2019s head with groundless\nfears. Years later, my former student sent me a paper he\u2019d written and a\nbrief account of his psychological therapy, which reassured me.\n    Another upsetting phone call occurred when I was sitting at a table in the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania bookstore on my first \u201cbook tour\u201d\u2014for The\nMind\u2019s I. I had been parked there uncomfortably for an hour or so, smiling\nat people who drifted up and mostly didn\u2019t buy, or ask me about, the books\nstacked on the little table, when a clerk came up and said I had an urgent\nphone call. When I got to the phone, the department secretary from Tufts\nsaid to me, \u201cDon\u2019t come to the office when you get back to Boston! A man\nhas called and he said he\u2019s coming to kill you!\u201d He\u2019d given his name, and\n\fafter I got home\u2014giving Tufts a wide berth\u2014I managed to learn more\nabout him. He was a graduate student of a famous philosopher, and he had\nvoluntarily checked himself into a Boston-area psychiatric hospital\u2014but he\ncould leave at any time. He\u2019d decided that I had been stealing all his ideas\nbefore he could get them into print, so he was going to kill me. I spoke to\nthe man\u2019s psychiatrist, who tried to reassure me that this fellow was\nobviously seriously deluded but wouldn\u2019t hurt anybody. And, the\npsychiatrist added to reassure me, his patient had also threatened the life of\nTed Kennedy. At first, this calmed me down. If he\u2019d threatened Kennedy,\nthere were sure to be Secret Service agents or FBI agents or somebody\nwatching his movements closely, so I was OK. But then it struck me that\nperhaps these stalwart Kennedy-protectors would watch him leave the\nhospital and as soon as he headed north (to Tufts, to my home in Andover)\nthey would sigh with relief and say to themselves, \u201cNothing for us to worry\nabout\u2014he\u2019s going after that philosopher.\u201d I extracted a promise from the\npsychiatrist that he would call me if the fellow checked out of the hospital,\nand I decided to go about my life as if nothing had happened. The fellow\ndid leave the hospital, I later learned (the psychiatrist hadn\u2019t kept his\npromise). Moreover, a year or so later he applied for a job in our philosophy\ndepartment. We get hundreds of applications, and I decided I wouldn\u2019t\nmention this as long as the fellow didn\u2019t make our short list. But he did! So,\nI had to tell my colleagues at the short-list meeting that while I didn\u2019t\npresume to have any veto rights, I would appreciate it if they removed his\nname from the short list, since this was the person who had threatened to\nkill me. (They knew the story but not his name, which I waited until then to\nreveal.) I am happy to say that my colleagues granted my request. Some\nyears later, I got an apologetic note from this man. I thanked him but did not\nencourage him in his suggestion that we might have a talk about our mutual\ninterests in philosophy.", "location": 421327}

{"paragraph": "Thank Goodness! (November 2, 2006)\n   There are no atheists in foxholes, according to an old but dubious\n   saying, and there is at least a little anecdotal evidence in favor of it in\n   the notorious cases of famous atheists who have emerged from near-\n   death experiences to announce to the world that they have changed\n   their minds. The British philosopher Sir A. J. Ayer, who died in 1989,\n   is a fairly recent example. Here is another anecdote to ponder.\n       Two weeks ago, I was rushed by ambulance to a hospital where it\n   was determined by c-t scan that I had a \u201cdissection of the aorta\u201d\u2014the\n   lining of the main output vessel carrying blood from my heart had\n   been torn up, creating a two-channel pipe where there should only be\n   one. Fortunately for me, the fact that I\u2019d had a coronary artery bypass\n   graft seven years ago probably saved my life, since the tangle of scar\n\ftissue that had grown like ivy around my heart in the intervening\nyears reinforced the aorta, preventing catastrophic leakage from the\ntear in the aorta itself. After a nine-hour surgery, in which my heart\nwas stopped entirely and my body and brain were chilled down to\nabout 45 degrees to prevent brain damage from lack of oxygen until\nthey could get the heart-lung machine pumping, I am now the proud\npossessor of a new aorta up to the aortic arch, made of strong Dacron\nfabric tubing sewn into shape on the spot by the surgeon, attached to\nmy heart along with a carbon-fiber valve that makes a reassuring little\nclick every time my heart beats.\n    As I now enter a gentle period of recuperation, I have much to\nreflect on, about the harrowing experience itself and even more about\nthe flood of supporting messages I\u2019ve received since word got out\nabout my latest adventure. Friends were anxious to learn if I had had\na near-death experience, and if so, what effect it had had on my\nlongstanding public atheism. Had I had an epiphany? Was I going to\nfollow in the footsteps of Ayer (who recovered his aplomb and\ninsisted a few days later \u201cwhat I should have said is that my\nexperiences have weakened, not my belief that there is no life after\ndeath, but my inflexible attitude towards that belief\u201d), or was my\natheism still intact and unchanged?\n    Yes, I did have an epiphany. I saw with greater clarity than ever\nbefore in my life that when I say \u201cThank goodness!\u201d this is not\nmerely a euphemism for \u201cThank God!\u201d (We atheists don\u2019t believe that\nthere is any God to thank.) I really do mean thank goodness! There is\na lot of goodness in this world, and more goodness every day, and this\nfantastic human-made fabric of excellence is genuinely responsible\nfor the fact that I am alive today. It is a worthy recipient of the\ngratitude I feel today, and I want to celebrate that fact here and now.\n    To whom, then, do I owe a debt of gratitude? To the cardiologist\nwho has kept me alive and ticking for years, and who swiftly and\nconfidently rejected the original diagnosis of nothing worse than\npneumonia. To the surgeons, neurologists, anesthesiologists, and the\nperfusionist, who kept my systems going for many hours under\n\fdaunting circumstances. To the dozen or so physician assistants, and\nto nurses and physical therapists and x-ray technicians and a small\narmy of phlebotomists so deft that you hardly know they are drawing\nyour blood, and the people who brought the meals, kept my room\nclean, did the mountains of laundry generated by such a messy case,\nwheel-chaired me to x-ray, and so forth. These people came from\nUganda, Kenya, Liberia, Haiti, the Philippines, Croatia, Russia,\nChina, Korea, India\u2014and the United States, of course\u2014and I have\nnever seen more impressive mutual respect, as they helped each other\nout and checked each other\u2019s work. But for all their teamwork, this\nlocal gang could not have done their jobs without the huge\nbackground of contributions from others. I remember with gratitude\nmy late friend and Tufts colleague, physicist Allan Cormack, who\nshared the Nobel Prize for his invention of the c-t scanner. Allan\u2014\nyou have posthumously saved yet another life, but who\u2019s counting?\nThe world is better for the work you did. Thank goodness. Then there\nis the whole system of medicine, both the science and the technology,\nwithout which the best-intentioned efforts of individuals would be\nroughly useless. So I am grateful to the editorial boards and referees,\npast and present, of Science, Nature, Journal of the American Medical\nAssociation, Lancet, and all the other institutions of science and\nmedicine that keep churning out improvements, detecting and\ncorrecting flaws.\n    Do I worship modern medicine? Is science my religion? Not at all;\nthere is no aspect of modern medicine or science that I would exempt\nfrom the most rigorous scrutiny, and I can readily identify a host of\nserious problems that still need to be fixed. That\u2019s easy to do, of\ncourse, because the worlds of medicine and science are already\nengaged in the most obsessive, intensive, and humble self-\nassessments yet known to human institutions, and they regularly\nmake public the results of their self-examinations. Moreover, this\nopen-ended rational criticism, imperfect as it is, is the secret of the\nastounding success of these human enterprises. There are measurable\nimprovements every day. Had I had my blasted aorta a decade ago,\n\fthere would have been no prayer of saving me. It\u2019s hardly routine\ntoday, but the odds of my survival were actually not so bad (these\ndays, roughly 33 percent of aortic dissection patients die in the first\ntwenty-four hours after onset without treatment, and the odds get\nworse by the hour thereafter).\n    One thing in particular struck me when I compared the medical\nworld on which my life now depended with the religious institutions I\nhave been studying so intensively in recent years. One of the gentler,\nmore supportive themes to be found in every religion (so far as I\nknow) is the idea that what really matters is what is in your heart: if\nyou have good intentions, and are trying to do what (God says) is\nright, that is all anyone can ask. Not so in medicine! If you are wrong\n\u2014especially if you should have known better\u2014your good intentions\ncount for almost nothing. And whereas taking a leap of faith and\nacting without further scrutiny of one\u2019s options is often celebrated by\nreligions, it is considered a grave sin in medicine. A doctor whose\ndevout faith in his personal revelations about how to treat aortic\naneurysm led him to engage in untested trials with human patients\nwould be severely reprimanded if not driven out of medicine\naltogether. There are exceptions, of course. A few swashbuckling,\nrisk-taking pioneers are tolerated and (if they prove to be right)\neventually honored, but they can exist only as rare exceptions to the\nideal of the methodical investigator who scrupulously rules out\nalternative theories before putting his own into practice. Good\nintentions and inspiration are simply not enough.\n    In other words, whereas religions may serve a benign purpose by\nletting many people feel comfortable with the level of morality they\nthemselves can attain, no religion holds its members to the high\nstandards of moral responsibility that the secular world of science and\nmedicine does! And I\u2019m not just talking about the standards \u201cat the\ntop\u201d\u2014among the surgeons and doctors who make life or death\ndecisions every day. I\u2019m talking about the standards of\nconscientiousness endorsed by the lab technicians and meal preparers,\ntoo. This tradition puts its faith in the unlimited application of reason\n\fand empirical inquiry, checking and re-checking, and getting in the\nhabit of asking \u201cWhat if I\u2019m wrong?\u201d Appeals to faith or membership\nare never tolerated. Imagine the reception a scientist would get if he\ntried to suggest that others couldn\u2019t replicate his results because they\njust didn\u2019t share the faith of the people in his lab! And, to return to\nmy main point, it is the goodness of this tradition of reason and open\ninquiry that I thank for my being alive today.\n    What, though, do I say to those of my religious friends (and yes, I\nhave quite a few religious friends) who have had the courage and\nhonesty to tell me that they have been praying for me? I have gladly\nforgiven them, for there are few circumstances more frustrating than\nnot being able to help a loved one in any more direct way. I confess to\nregretting that I could not pray (sincerely) for my friends and family\nin time of need, so I appreciate the urge, however clearly I recognize\nits futility. I translate my religious friends\u2019 remarks readily enough\ninto one version or another of what my fellow brights [an attempt by\nme and others to popularize a new term for unbelievers; see chapter\n27] have been telling me: \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about you, and wishing\nwith all my heart [another ineffective but irresistible self-indulgence]\nthat you come through this OK.\u201d The fact that these dear friends have\nbeen thinking of me in this way, and have taken an effort to let me\nknow, is in itself, without any need for a supernatural supplement, a\nwonderful tonic. These messages from my family and from friends\naround the world have been literally heart-warming in my case, and I\nam grateful for the boost in morale (to truly manic heights, I fear!)\nthat it has produced in me. But I am not joking when I say that I have\nhad to forgive my friends who said that they were praying for me. I\nhave resisted the temptation to respond \u201cThanks, I appreciate it, but\ndid you also sacrifice a goat?\u201d I feel about this the same way I would\nfeel if one of them said \u201cI just paid a voodoo doctor to cast a spell for\nyour health.\u201d What a gullible waste of money that could have been\nspent on more important projects! Don\u2019t expect me to be grateful, or\neven indifferent. I do appreciate the affection and generosity of spirit\n\fthat motivated you, but wish you had found a more reasonable way of\nexpressing it.\n    But isn\u2019t this awfully harsh? Surely it does the world no harm if\nthose who can honestly do so pray for me! No, I\u2019m not at all sure\nabout that. For one thing, if they really wanted to do something\nuseful, they could devote their prayer time and energy to some\npressing project that they can do something about. For another, we\nnow have quite solid grounds (e.g., the recently released Benson\nstudy at Harvard) for believing that intercessory prayer simply\ndoesn\u2019t work. Anybody whose practice shrugs off that research is\nsubtly undermining respect for the very goodness I am thanking. If\nyou insist on keeping the myth of the effectiveness of prayer alive,\nyou owe the rest of us a justification in the face of the evidence.\nPending such a justification, I will excuse you for indulging in your\ntradition; I know how comforting tradition can be. But I want you to\nrecognize that what you are doing is morally problematic at best. If\nyou would even consider filing a malpractice suit against a doctor\nwho made a mistake in treating you, or suing a pharmaceutical\ncompany that didn\u2019t conduct all the proper control tests before selling\nyou a drug that harmed you, you must acknowledge your tacit\nappreciation of the high standards of rational inquiry to which the\nmedical world holds itself, and yet you continue to indulge in a\npractice for which there is no known rational justification at all, and\ntake yourself to be actually making a contribution. (Try to imagine\nyour outrage if a pharmaceutical company responded to your suit by\nblithely replying \u201cBut we prayed good and hard for the success of the\ndrug! What more do you want?\u201d)\n    The best thing about saying thank goodness in place of thank God\nis that there really are lots of ways of repaying your debt to goodness\n\u2014by setting out to create more of it, for the benefit of those to come.\nGoodness comes in many forms, not just medicine and science.\nThank goodness for the music of, say, Randy Newman, which could\nnot exist without all those wonderful pianos and recording studios, to\nsay nothing of the musical contributions of every great composer\n\f   from Bach through Wagner to Scott Joplin and the Beatles. Thank\n   goodness for fresh drinking water in the tap, and food on our table.\n   Thank goodness for fair elections and truthful journalism. If you want\n   to express your gratitude to goodness, you can plant a tree, feed an\n   orphan, buy books for schoolgirls in the Islamic world, or contribute\n   in thousands of other ways to the manifest improvement of life on this\n   planet now and in the near future.\n       Or you can thank God\u2014but the very idea of repaying God is\n   ludicrous. What could an omniscient, omnipotent Being (the Man\n   Who Has Everything?) do with any paltry repayments from you?\n   (And besides, according to the Christian tradition God has already\n   redeemed the debt for all time, by sacrificing his own son. Try to\n   repay that loan!) Yes, I know, those themes are not to be understood\n   literally; they are symbolic. I grant it, but then the idea that by\n   thanking God you are actually doing some good has got to be\n   understood to be just symbolic, too. I prefer real good to symbolic\n   good.\n       Still, I excuse those who pray for me. I see them as like tenacious\n   scientists who resist the evidence for theories they don\u2019t like long\n   after a graceful concession would have been the appropriate response.\n   I applaud you for your loyalty to your own position\u2014but remember:\n   loyalty to tradition is not enough. You\u2019ve got to keep asking yourself:\n   What if I\u2019m wrong? In the long run, I think religious people can be\n   asked to live up to the same moral standards as secular people in\n   science and medicine.", "location": 4727}

{"paragraph": "In my first stint as a philosophy professor at Irvine, I was unsettled by\nthe blank looks I would get from students when I mentioned some landmark\ncultural figure, so I devised a culture quiz to assay this dearth of what I had\nthought would be common knowledge among my sun-drenched students.\nFifty well-known names: Michelangelo\u2014if you answer just \u201cartist,\u201d you\nget one point; if you answer \u201cItalian Renaissance artist,\u201d you get two. The\naverage grade among the hundred or so freshmen taking introductory\nphilosophy from me was about 40. Among the answers I got were some\ngems exhibiting how a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing:\nCopernicus\u2014Caesar\u2019s wife; Cervantes\u2014half man/half horse; Henry James\n\u2014author of the Henry James Version of the Bible.\n\f                          Back to Harvard\nMy goal of \u201crefuting\u201d Quine did not lapse after my lackluster showing in\nhis class; it actually intensified. I asked Quine which thinkers offered the\nmost interesting alternatives to his views, and he recommended the work of\nNoam Chomsky and the UC Berkeley logician Lotfi Zadeh, whose \u201cfuzzy\nset theory\u201d challenged his own version of set theory. He also recommended\nthe work of his friend B. F. Skinner for a supporting view. I read Chomsky\u2019s\nfamous review of Skinner\u2019s Verbal Behavior, which had just appeared, but\n\u2014unlike most budding cognitive scientists\u2014I also read Skinner\u2019s book, and\nI decided that Chomsky\u2019s review was a masterpiece of misleading polemics.\nThat was my earliest encounter with deliberate caricature in academia, and\nit was an eye-opener. For my three years at Harvard, I devoted large\nportions of my study time to reading and thinking about these and other\ncritics, while taking as many philosophy courses as I could, seasoned by a\nsprinkling of other humanities courses.\n    I managed not to take any science courses! My math logic course with\nKyburg at Wesleyan both fulfilled the logic requirement in the philosophy\ndepartment and was deemed a science course, and I can\u2019t remember what\nother fringe-sciency course I plugged in to cover the \u201cdistribution\u201d\nrequirement. No biology, no chemistry or physics, no labs, and no\npsychology! I didn\u2019t take a course with Skinner, though I could have, but I\nhad been steered away from psychology by an episode in my high school\nyears. My older sister, Cynthia, went to Mount Holyoke, and I vividly\nremember the round-trip drive to South Hadley that Mother and I made to\npick up Cynthia for Thanksgiving her freshman year (when I was just\ngetting settled in Exeter). On the way home, I eagerly grilled her about all\nher courses. She was taking an introduction to psychology, which whetted\nmy appetite. The mind! Consciousness! I could hardly wait to hear what\nshe\u2019d been learning. She told me about William Sheldon\u2019s theory of body\ntypes: ectomorph, endomorph, and mesomorph. Yuck! From the \u201940s\nthrough the \u201970s, Sheldon\u2019s crackpot theory was an active focus of research.\nHe had organized a research project involving thousands of \u201cposture\nphotographs\u201d taken of nude Ivy League and Seven Sisters students and\n\fthought he could determine personality types by charting the differences. I\nhad in fact had my three posture photos (frontal, profile, and back) taken at\nExeter that year and was dubious of the whole scheme. Physique was\ndestiny? If psychologists took this seriously (in fact many of them did; it\nwas in the textbooks), I wanted nothing to do with psychology. That snap\njudgment at age sixteen caused me to ignore all psychology, good and bad,\nuntil I was a graduate student.\n   Psychology has had a hard time attracting the best students for decades. I\nremember Princeton philosopher Harry Frankfurt telling me a joke\nsometime in the \u201980s: \u201cDan, do you know why psychologists are so\nstupid?\u201d\n   \u201cNo,\u201d I replied, \u201cI\u2019ve often wondered.\u201d\n   \u201cIt\u2019s because every large state university has an introductory psychology\ncourse with about a thousand students in it. Around Thanksgiving time, the\nlecturer intones, \u2018One of the things we have learned in psychology is that\nactions followed by reward tend to be repeated, and actions followed by\npunishment tend not to be.\u2019 Nine hundred and ninety-five students mutter,\n\u2018What else is new?\u2019 but five think \u2018That\u2019s really interesting!\u2019 They go on to\nbe psychologists.\u201d\n   I knew better by then, but it has taken half a century for psychology to\nshake off the reputation it got from (caricatures of) some of its dubious\ndiscoveries. There is a reason for this, I think. Folk psychology, the scheme\nwe all use to understand one another (I call it the intentional stance, not\ntheory of mind) presupposes that everybody is roughly rational. You won\u2019t\nget or deserve any attention for a study establishing that subjects prefer five\ndollars to a poke in the eye with a sharp stick (What else is new?). So\npsychologists often try to figure out ways to induce pathology in normal\nsubjects\u2014to put a strain on their capacities so that they make telling\nmistakes that reveal something about the mechanisms or strategies they are\nusing, consciously or not, to do the task they have been asked to do.\nPerceptual psychologists have devised famous illusions to which almost\neverybody succumbs. Cognitive psychologists induce subjects to exhibit\npatterns of errors in inferences, or to think they are causing some effect\nwhen they are not. Neuropsychologists use transcranial magnetic\n\fstimulation (for instance) to get subjects to misjudge this or that. If you\ncan\u2019t get people to make mistakes, their minds seem to work by magic,\nmiraculously figuring out what\u2019s what. So psychologists often appear to be\ntelling the general public that we\u2019re not as smart as we think we are, but\nsince like all scientists they sometimes oversell their own research, they\ndon\u2019t get much sympathy when their vaunted results evaporate, as they\noccasionally do.\n    Another soft barrier that kept me away from psychology as an\nundergraduate was that at Harvard an interdisciplinary concentration\n(Harvard\u2019s word for \u201cmajor\u201d) called social relations, or \u201csoc rel,\u201d more or\nless swallowed up the psychology concentration, and it was an unappetizing\n(to me) mixture of psychology, sociology, and anthropology. So I never\ntook a course from George Miller or Jerome Bruner, who were starting the\nCenter for Cognitive Studies there (the birth, one might say, of cognitive\nscience), and I never took a course from Timothy Leary, who was emerging\nat Harvard\u2014and indeed everywhere in the world\u2014as the leading exponent\nof psychedelic drugs.

{"paragraph": "Some true sentences, such as \u201c2 + 2 = 4,\u201d were a priori, necessarily true,\nand their truth could be determined by an analysis of the meanings of the\nterms in them, without any need to get out of one\u2019s armchair and conduct an\nempirical investigation. Other true sentences, such as \u201cThere is cheese on\nthe plate,\u201d were a posteriori, or synthetic: you had to look to the world to\nsee if they were true. Quine argued that this was a good rough-and-ready\ndistinction for some purposes but not as sharp as philosophers and logicians\n\fthought. That struck me as a wonderfully subversive idea, but I thought he\nwas wrong about some of his ways of putting things. So I decided, as only a\nfreshman could, that I had to go to Harvard and confront this man with my\ncorrections to his errors! I thereupon filled out my application to transfer to\nHarvard, where I was accepted as a transfer student, and spent the rest of\nmy freshman year reading Quine, Wittgenstein\u2014and Freud.\n    Norman O. Brown, \u201cNobby\u201d to everyone at Wesleyan, was a classicist\nand literary theorist whose cult book, Life against Death: the\nPsychoanalytical Meaning of History, was published that year and caused\nquite a stir in humanities circles, thanks to Norman Podhoretz and Lionel\nTrilling, who praised it to the skies. Deep stuff, with sex and anxiety thrown\nin for good measure. And then there was Nietzsche, whose Thus Spake\nZarathustra and Genealogy of Morals were introduced to me in my actual\nphilosophy class, along with Descartes\u2019s Meditations and Discourse on\nMethod, Hume\u2019s Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, and a bunch of\nother classics. The class was taught brilliantly by Louis Mink, who\npersuaded me that I should become a philosopher after I held forth in class\nwith some passion that Descartes\u2019s dualism was hopelessly wrong\u2014and it\nshouldn\u2019t take me too long to say why. Sixty years later I\u2019m still hammering\naway on poor old Descartes, who was indeed wrong, in spite of having\nsome clever arguments that had to wait for Darwin to dismantle in passing.\n    I thought it would be wise to enroll in Harvard Summer School just so I\ncould acquaint myself better with the classrooms and other places I\u2019d be\nfrequenting when classes started in September. I signed up for a single\ncourse, on the history of the symphony, which met at nine every morning. I\nwould drive in from Winchester, park in the lot just in front of Paine Hall,\nthe music building, and review my notes from the previous day. As luck\nwould have it, a beautiful sophomore art major from Smith College, Susan\nBell, drove to Cambridge from her home in Wellesley to take the same\ncourse. I was instantly smitten. At the time, I was working on a sculpture in\nwood of a young woman in a pensive pose and was having difficulties with\nthe shoulders. I made bold to ask her if she, with her perfect shoulders,\nmight model for me. No way, she said, but she didn\u2019t spurn me thereafter.\nSoon Susan and I were arriving earlier and earlier in the morning to sit in\n\fone car or the other and talk. After class we\u2019d go to the music library in\nPaine Hall to check out the records assigned to us for the next day and take\nthem into one of the soundproof listening rooms to do our homework. The\nlibrarian who checked out the records soon began giving me smarmy looks\nwhen he handed me the day\u2019s LPs and I sauntered off into the isolation\nbooth with Susan to listen. One day, I quietly excused myself from the\nlistening room and rushed to his desk. \u201cQuick!\u201d I said. \u201cRavel\u2019s Bolero!\u201d\nHe jumped up, but when he saw I was joking he reddened and turned away,\nand thereafter he treated us with punctilious respect.\n    In September I was assigned to Eliot House, where the classicist John\nFinley, one of my father\u2019s old friends, was master. My room was the sixth\nroom of a double-triple suite, one of whose would-be occupants had\ndropped out of college over the summer. The five returnees knew each other\nwell, of course, but they accepted my intrusion with grace, and soon we all\nbecame lifelong friends. Susan was a familiar visitor to the suite, for our\nsummer romance continued and intensified. (A curious but negligible fact is\nthat Ted Kaczynski, who became the Unabomber, was living just a few feet\naway from us, on the same floor in the next entry, but I never interacted\nwith him personally.)\n    Master Finley was a great character, and a legendary writer of letters of\nrecommendation; during his mastership, Eliot House produced more\nRhodes Scholars to Oxford than Yale and Princeton combined. He was also\na bold brandisher of metaphors, describing one of our housemates in a\npublished interview as \u201ca cross between Reinhold Niebuhr and an eagle.\u201d\nHe began one of his little talks to us with \u201cI think we can divide recent\nhistory into three ages: the age of Sir Walter Scott, the age of F. Scott\nFitzgerald, and the age of Scott tissues.\u201d We\u2019d sometimes play a game we\ncalled \u201cFinley,\u201d taking turns playing the master: \u201cTell me, Master Finley,\nwhat do you get when you cross a Chevrolet with a sphinx?\u201d \u201cWhy do\nbacon and eggs always remind you of Sophocles?\u201d\n    The first class I enrolled in was Quine\u2019s philosophy of language course,\nthe main text for which was his newly published book, Word and Object. I\nhad arrived just in time and was eager to get to the bottom of this major\nwork with him. It was an impressive class: Thomas Nagel and David Lewis\n\fwere two of the star graduate students in it, along with David\u2019s wife-to-be,\nStephanie, Gilbert Harman, Margaret Wilson and her husband Emmett,\nMichael Slote, and others. Saul Kripke was not in the course, but he was on\ncampus, a readily recognizable figure in the library, davening (rocking back\nand forth) as he read. He was rudely nicknamed the Mad Bobber by\nstudents who didn\u2019t know he was a certified wunderkind, a logical genius\nwho had purportedly blown Quine\u2019s reservations about modal logic to\nsmithereens when just a teenager. I\u2019ve never really gotten to know Saul\nwell, though our paths have often crossed. He and I were approaching\nQuine from opposite directions, and I didn\u2019t expect he\u2019d be any more\ninterested in my objections than I was in his.\n   I didn\u2019t do very well in Quine\u2019s course, because although I wrote a fairly\nimpressive term paper, I freaked out on the final exam. I had been poring\nover his book so intensely that I had way too much to say in a short essay,\nand I ended up answering just one of the three essay questions, at great\nlength. Dagfinn F\u00f8llesdal, Quine\u2019s grader, took pity on me and gave me a\nB\u2013in the course. I was undeterred. I knew I was no good at writing essay\nexams. As Marshall Cohen, my advisor, once said when I had written a\nsimilarly misshapen exam in his course, \u201cDon\u2019t try to write an original\npublishable essay, Dan.

{"paragraph": "Gerald Edelman\nIn 1989\u201390, Peter Bieri, a Swiss philosopher and novelist, got a grant to\nsupport a yearlong workshop on mind and brain at ZiF, the Zentrum f\u00fcr\ninterdisziplin\u00e4re Forschung (Center for Interdisciplinary Research) in\nBielefeld, Germany. Bieri\u2019s taste in interdisciplinary researchers was\nexcellent, and among those who spent weeks or months or semesters in the\nworkshop that year were the American philosophers David Rosenthal and\nJay Rosenberg, the German neurobiologist Hans Flohr, the German\npsychologist Eckart Scheerer, the Belgian psychologist Axel Cleeremans,\nthe British psychologist Tony Marcel, the American neuroscientist and\nneurosurgeon Karl Pribram, and three of my gang of four: Marcel\nKinsbourne, Nick Humphrey, and me. Many friendships and conclusions\ngot established that year.\n   Karl Pribram, something of a legendary character in the field, was there\nfor several months, and I got to know him well. He was famous for\ncoauthoring, with George Miller and Eugene Galanter, one of the founding\ndocuments of cognitive science, Plans and the Structure of Behavior\n(1960), which valiantly attempted to take the fruits of behaviorism and\nexploit them in a model of internal control systems. (An old joke was that\nMiller thought it up, Galanter wrote it, and Pribram believed it.) He was\nalso (in)famous for his typically imaginative theory that the brain stores\ninformation as holograms, a view that never quite came into focus. One day\nhe handed me an advance copy he had just received of The Remembered\nPresent, a book by the Nobel laureate Gerald Edelman, which he had been\ninvited to review. He confessed that he had skimmed it and decided it was\ntoo much work. He wondered if I\u2019d be interested. Yes indeed, but not to\nwrite a review, just to read. The title itself was slightly ominous to me, since\n\fit hinted that perhaps Edelman was about to scoop me on some of my ideas\nabout time and the observer, which I was then trying to wrestle into shape. I\nhad been on programs with Edelman a few times and had read his Neural\nDarwinism: The Theory of Neuronal Group Selection (1987), one of many\nattempts to apply evolutionary thinking to brain development and learning.\nI found Edelman abrasive and contentious, but certainly very smart, and\noverflowing with interesting claims and insights. He was scheduled to\nspend a week at the workshop in Bielefeld later in the spring, when I would\nbe away at one of Umberto Eco\u2019s conferences at the University of San\nMarino, so I pushed my way through Edelman\u2019s book and wrote him a\nmultipage letter explaining that I wouldn\u2019t be at ZiF when he visited, and\ncommenting on his views and presentation, hoping he would thereby be\nalerted to some of the challenges that were under discussion in Bielefeld. I\nraised a number of criticisms and in particular charged him with failing to\nnote that some of his ideas had been well prefigured by thinkers he\ndismissed unfairly\u2014potential allies with whom he was picking gratuitous\nfights. He wrote me back a short note inviting me to visit his lab at\nRockefeller University whenever I found myself in New York so we could\ndiscuss my letter.\n    That opportunity soon came up when I was giving some lectures at NYU\nand had a free Saturday in the city. I expected that he and I would sit down\nfor a long, constructive chat, so I sent him the draft of the chapter of\nConsciousness Explained that presented my overview of the architecture of\nconsciousness and contained a brief discussion of his views. When I got to\nhis lab at Rockefeller, I found that he had ordered his team to spend the\nmorning grilling me and objecting to the ideas in my draft chapter, which he\nhad shared with them, although he hadn\u2019t shared my earlier letter, which\nwould have provided a wealth of context. Giulio Tononi and Olaf Sporns\nled the attack in a sort of tag-team wrestling match, with Gerry egging them\non. I was also obliged to sit through one of his multimedia slide lectures,\nwhich I had already heard two or three times. That he would require his\nbrilliant young associates to spend a beautiful spring Saturday morning\nattacking me, without giving them the background of the occasion, was the\nfirst sign I had of his almost childish inability to listen to criticism. I took\n\fmy pummeling and left unenlightened, and later wrote an email to Sporns\nand Tononi telling them about my letter.\n    A few years later, Edelman moved his Neurosciences Institute from\nRockefeller to La Jolla, just a mile or so from Francis Crick\u2019s lab at UC San\nDiego. The two Nobel laureates were not friends, and Gerry was not invited\nto the afternoon \u201cteas\u201d that Francis presided over. One time I was invited to\ngive a talk at the Crick lab, and several of Edelman\u2019s young associates came\nto hear my talk, staying afterward to question me (constructively!) at length.\nI noticed that they were somewhat nervously looking at their watches and\nasked them about it. They candidly replied that they had had to sneak out of\nGerry\u2019s lab to come hear me and were quite sure they\u2019d be fired if he got\nword of their betrayal. In 1992, Edelman and I were together with Oliver\nSacks at a conference in Locarno, and when I tried to introduce Susan to the\ngreat man during a coffee break, he took one look at me, said, \u201cHello,\nfake!\u201d and instead of shaking hands, turned abruptly and left the room,\nleaving us astonished. He then packed his bag and left the conference early.\nI had a long talk over dinner with Oliver, who had been swept up by\nEdelman into his posse, and soon thereafter Oliver drifted away from him.\n    If only Gerry had learned to treat others\u2019 views more sympathetically\nand had resisted the temptation to divide the world into Us versus Them, he\ncould have had a lot more influence. He obliged his colleagues to sign\nloyalty oaths that forbade them to divulge what was happening in his lab.\nThat level of secrecy is often an unfortunate feature of races for Nobel\nPrizes, and Gerry made no secret of his desire to beat out Linus Pauling,\nwho had received two Nobel Prizes. Gerry was aiming for three! In addition\nto his prize in immunology, he figured he deserved one for his discovery of\ncell-adhesion molecules\u2014and he was probably right\u2014but he also wanted\none for his theory of consciousness in the brain. Harboring such a desire is\none thing and telling people about it is another. Gerry was sometimes\nremarkably obtuse in his interpersonal dealings, and it cost him greatly. It\nmay well have cost him that second Nobel Prize.\n    Some years later, the Boston Society of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and\nPsychiatry, an ancient and distinguished organization headquartered at\nHarvard Medical School, invited Edelman to give a talk, and the host\u2014not\n\fknowing of the bad blood between Gerry and me\u2014invited me to be the\nimpromptu commentator. I accepted. When I walked into the Harvard\nClub\u2019s private dining room for the dinner before the talk, Gerry looked like\nhe\u2019d seen a ghost. He hadn\u2019t been told I\u2019d be the respondent, and it clearly\nbothered him. While he was setting up his multimedia show\u2014with a\ncarousel of slides and some videotapes in those days\u2014I asked him politely\nif I might record the session. Since it was impromptu, I thought one of us\nmight say something that would be worth reflecting on later. He glowered at\nme and responded, \u201cI know what you\u2019re doing: you\u2019re just asking me in\norder to get me to refuse so you can say afterward that I refused, but you\u2019re\nnot going to trap me that way.

{"paragraph": "WE SOLD OUR BELOVED FARM in 2013, the year after I sold my beloved\nXanthippe. Due to worsening arthritis and other ailments, I could no longer\nget around as well, and deferred maintenance had taken its toll on both. We\nfound a wonderful house on the shore of Little Deer Isle, on Eggemoggin\nReach, and decided we would trade in haying and apple-tree pruning and\nlogging for sitting on the porch watching the great parade of sailboats, from\nwindjammer schooners to racing sloops and yawls to cruising boats and\ndaysailers, along with the dozens of lobster boats.\n\f    Do I miss the farm? Yes and no. The farmhouse itself had been lovingly\nrestored by us, from the floors, to the walls, to the chimneys and stoves; and\nwe added plumbing and dozens of electrical outlets. Walter Leighton was a\nplumber, but the only plumbing he had in his house was the lead pipe that\nran to the dug well behind the house from the kitchen hand pump; we had\nan excellently designed in-house outhouse in the attached shed, a well-\nventilated three-holer above an open concrete tank Leighton had built. You\ncould walk to it through the attached shed in the winter keeping your feet\ndry, and the tank had to be emptied only twice during our years there. The\nfirst time, George and I did it ourselves with shovels and buckets and spent\nthe rest of the afternoon washing in a local pond. The second time, I called\nin the \u201choney wagon,\u201d and the fellow who ran it took the better part of an\nhour figuring out that the stuff he was pumping out of the tank was not his\nusual septic sludge. \u201cThat\u2019s not a septic tank, is it?\u201d he said. \u201cNope,\u201d I\nreplied. He finished the job and left.\n    The house included other fascinating oddities, hidden away. Under the\neaves, there were \u201cship\u2019s knees,\u201d large Y-shaped natural tree branchings cut\noff and used to brace the hewn post-and-beam construction, fastened to the\nplates (horizontal wall beams atop the posts), and floor timbers with large\ntrunnels (wooden pegs or \u201ctree nails\u201d). Since the hewn sills and plates had\nto be trunneled to the vertical posts before any studs could be mortise-and-\ntenoned into them, the studs couldn\u2019t be fastened at both top and bottom, so\nthey alternated, stalactite and stalagmite, with free-floating ends, but the\nwhole wall was held together by the boarding boards, which had been sash-\nsawn (with an up-and-down saw), while the clapboards nailed to them had\nbeen circular-sawn by an early clapboard mill. This permitted us to date the\nhouse to about 1830, when the first circular saws arrived in Maine. Hidden\nunder layers of wallpaper on the front hall were Moses Eaton stencils,\nwhich we carefully restored. It was a satisfying detective job, since the\npaint had pulled off the old plaster walls in many places, leaving islands of\npartial stencil patterns. I traced all the patterns with tracing paper and then\nheld several tracings overlapped up to the light to look for completions and,\nas luck would have it, was able to extract complete versions of all the\npatterns\u2014oak leaves and vine twinings and flowers of several sorts. I made\n\fnew stencils out of oak tag, and after we\u2019d repainted and stenciled the walls\nI took our stencils to the Society for the Preservation of New England\nAntiquities in the Harrison Gray Otis house in Boston, where Moses\nEaton\u2019s stencil kit is in storage. My stencils matched his perfectly. The\nkitchen floor, when we bought the house, was covered with dirty, cracked\nlinoleum, and we decided a wood floor would be better, but when we\nstripped off the linoleum, we found diagonal subfloor boarding. What to\ndo? We decided to make the most of the diagonals by creating a diamond\npattern of stencils that we could paint on the floor, making it look tiled, and\nthen varnishing it over. It was the summer of 1973, and the Watergate\nhearings were underway. We didn\u2019t want to miss a minute of them, and in\nlater years whenever I looked at the stencils on the kitchen floor, I\nremembered that this batch over here I painted while listening to Attorney\nGeneral John Mitchell, and that was the John Dean patch over there.\n    I knew every cubic inch of that house intimately. I had crawled into\nevery nook, under every floor, filling in insulation between the ceiling joists\nin the attic, snaking electric cables through walls, building an indoor\nbathroom under a gable I constructed in the roof, shoveling porcupines\u2019\npoop out of their winter home in our dirt-floored cellar. Forty years of\nlargely do-it-yourself handiwork. I reshingled the house and the sheds and\nswept clean the chimneys with my weighted chimney brush on a rope. I\nalmost fell off the shed roof while shingling it when I lifted up a corner of\nthe lead sheathing around the chimney and two bats who lived there flew\nout in my face.\n    When the old barn seemed about to collapse, we hired an expert team of\nhouse movers who lifted the whole barn up on huge steel I-beams, pulled\nthe whole barn south about seventy feet, and left it on pilings while a new\nconcrete foundation was built to replace the falling-in fieldstone walls.\nThey then pulled the barn back north, onto its new foundations a foot or so\nhigher than the old. They lubricated the steel rails with half a dozen bars of\nIvory soap vigorously rubbed into the steel, making them \u201cslick as snot,\u201d as\nmy neighbor put it, and getting the job done with hardly a rumble or\nvibration.\n\f   All of these projects were the highlights of many years, but toward the\nend of that era I had learned about as much as I could about how to split and\nstack firewood, how to prune and fertilize apple trees, how to mow hay in\nan orchard, and how to keep the woods from encroaching into the fields,\nand when we sold the farm one of the first things I noticed was that I no\nlonger felt a pang of guilt when I saw that some farmer had mowed his hay\nand mine was still standing, overdue for harvesting. I no longer owned\nhayfields that needed harvesting! Whee! Freedom!", "location": 335170}

The day before I had been in\nMackerel Cove on Swan\u2019s Island in Maine on my sailboat, Xanthippe. This\nwas the last cruise of the season, joined by my Swedish friend Bo Dahlbom\nand his son Fredrik, and as I slowly pulled on the heavy anchor line I felt a\nslight pain in my chest, reminding me of the pain I had felt seven years\nearlier when I\u2019d had a \u201csilent heart attack\u201d that had led to a triple-bypass\noperation.

So I\u2019ve been\nbrainwashed, quite literally. Did it work?

If he carries his incisive and witty red pen in his\nbreast pocket I will recognize him immediately should we meet.\u201d) Knowing\nthat we were both invited to a philosophers\u2019 party at the APA meeting that\nyear, she wrote me a charming note warning me in advance that she was not\n\u201ca sweet young thing\u201d but a mother with grown children\u2014just in case I had\nbeen harboring fantasies, I guess.\n    The Secret Seminar that Jerry Fodor and I had started in 1973 was still\ngoing strong when her first book came out, and I suggested that we all read\nit together and invite Ruth to come and discuss it with us. How could they\nsay no? I had written the foreword and had praised the book to them. The\ngroup was more than living up to my private name for it, the Vicious Circle,\nand sometimes degenerated into a contest among the younger members to\nsee who could make the most blistering criticisms of whatever we were\nreading, often beginning with \u201cWho recommended that we read this shit?\u201d\nThey had a bad case of Not Invented Here, a notorious affliction of closed-\nmindedness that often hits major think tanks.

A philosopher who also had a career in AI\n\fas a knowledge-extractor and designer of expert systems, she knew the\nferocity of philosophical infighting, but also shared my appreciation of\ncooperative intellectual teamwork. Without Sue to keep me from exploding,\nI would have walked away from the Secret Seminar years before I did.\n    I thought Ruth should be given the chance to open their eyes. She\naccepted the invitation and, to my great dismay, was subjected to the rudest,\nmost arrogant barrage of abuse I think I have ever witnessed from my\nfellow academics. She heroically pretended it wasn\u2019t happening, and calmly\nand firmly attempted to clarify her points, instead of walking out in disgust.\nI was livid. After she left, I gave Fodor and Block and the rest of the\nVicious Circle a proper scolding. They promised never to do it again and\nasked me to invite her back for a second attempt. She came back and they\nwere abusive again. That was the last meeting I ever attended, although the\ngroup continued for some years, inviting me to return whenever I liked.\nWhat I learned of the proceedings from colleagues who kept going\nconvinced me that I wasn\u2019t missing anything important.\n    At long last, Ruth\u2019s work has been recognized by the profession, and she\nhas been invited around the world to give talks and accept awards.

{"paragraph": "C  ALIFORNIA OPENED TWO NEW CAMPUSES OF THE         UNIVERSITY of California\nin 1965: Irvine in the south and Santa Cruz in the north. The Irvine campus\nwas built on 1,500 acres donated by the Irvine family, whose ranch\nstretched from the mountains to the sea, and when it opened for students in\n1965 there was hardly a blade of grass on the campus. Susan and I, who had\nrarely been west of the Hudson River, drove across the country with little\nidea of what to expect. The day we arrived and entered the campus on the\nnewly built Campus Drive, we had to stop and let two cowboys on horses\nherding several hundred cattle cross the road. There had been a town of\nIrvine in the foothills, but the Irvine family changed the name of it to East\nIrvine, so that the university could be called UC Irvine, not UC Newport\nBeach or UC Corona del Mar, the coastal towns on the ranch property.\nMother\u2019s brother, Uncle Paul, and his wife, Laverne, had retired from\nMinnesota to Palm Desert, and when Mother wrote to tell them that her\nbrilliant son Danny had accepted a job at UC Irvine, they got out a road\nmap and made a scouting trip to Irvine to see the place. They found the old\nsign saying Entering Irvine, and after driving for a few miles through\norange and walnut groves and past a lone gas station, they saw a sign saying\nLeaving Irvine. They doubled back, thinking they must have missed a turn.\nNothing. Mother got a hilarious letter suggesting that her brilliant son\nDanny was the victim of a hoax; there was no university in Irvine! But there\nwas, and by the time we arrived, the first circle of buildings was complete\n\fand hundreds of trees were being planted in the \u201cCentrum,\u201d a dusty park-to-\nbe. I could touch thumb to finger around any of the trunks of the new trees\nstaked up and watered by sprinklers. Today some of those trunks in the\nCentrum are more than a meter in diameter.\n    In 1963\u201364, the newly appointed deans had been hired, and they began\nappointing department chairpeople, who spent the next academic year\nworking out of trailers, hiring the first faculty and setting up labs while the\nfirst buildings were being finished. There were about a hundred faculty and\nsixteen hundred students when UCI opened in October of 1965, and I taught\nthe very first class, Introduction to Philosophy, at 8:30 a.m. on the first day\nof classes; the day\u2019s topic was Descartes\u2019s Meditations. There were about a\nhundred students in the class, and I had two teaching assistants, graduate\nstudents of Abe Melden\u2019s whom he had brought with him from the\nUniversity of Washington in Seattle. They were both older than I was, so I\nwas in a delicate situation, but we got along well, and I learned a lot from\nthem. In effect, I did my graduate education backward, finishing a\ndissertation first and then studying hard for several years in many courses\u2014\nexcept that I was teaching them. Melden was busy helping to create the\nAcademic Senate and supervising his graduate students, so I taught the\nundergraduate curriculum more or less single-handedly. This included,\nbesides the introductory course, a full-year survey of the history of\nphilosophy from Thales and the pre-Socratics through medieval philosophy\nand on to modern philosophy, ending with some Carnap and Wittgenstein,\nand courses in epistemology and metaphysics. E. J. (Jack) Lemmon, a\nwonderful British logician then at the Claremont Graduate School, taught\nour introductory logic course as a visiting professor, and was due to join us\nat UCI in the fall of 1966, but he died of a heart attack while climbing on\nMount Baldy with a graduate student in July, a severe blow to Melden and\nme, since he was both brilliant and delightful and we had looked forward to\nbuilding a department around him.\n    Melden, Lemmon, and I were the department of philosophy that first\nyear. I loved it. I am glad that no recordings of my history lectures were\nmade (so far as I know), since, like Danny Daniels, I was just a few days\nahead of the students, especially in medieval philosophy, which I had never\n\fstudied at all, and I no doubt sometimes expressed shockingly na\u00efve and ill-\ninformed views about the thinkers, their times, and their arguments. There\nis a lot to be said, however, for teaching courses on material you don\u2019t yet\nknow well, because energizing your students with your excitement about\nthese novelties often does more good than informing them, reliably, about\nthe standard interpretations, objections, and defenses.\n    Shortly before I left Oxford, Gilbert Ryle had asked me to read the\nmanuscript of his 1966 historical detective work, Plato\u2019s Progress, before\nhe sent it to Cambridge University Press, which I did, finding almost\nnothing to improve or fix. He called it his \u201cnaughty book\u201d on Plato, not\nbecause there was anything risqu\u00e9 in it but because he argued for a\nrenegade account of the dating of Plato\u2019s dialogues, which he claimed had\nfirst been \u201cpublished\u201d as performed plays at the Olympic games. Plato\nplayed the role of Socrates, and the reason for the absence of Socrates from\nthe later dialogues is that Plato was old and suffering from some infirmity\n(a toothache perhaps?) that kept him off the stage. There is much more\niconoclastic sleuthing in the book, with confident declarations that some of\nPlato\u2019s writings were forged, and many other vivid hypotheses, supported\nby a breathtaking mountain of evidence. One of Ryle\u2019s eccentricities was\nhis abjuring of footnotes in his own writing (perhaps Danny was inspired by\nhim). There is not a single footnote in The Concept of Mind or Dilemmas\n(1954). Ryle\u2019s practice worked well in his informal but precise ordinary-\nlanguage philosophy, but it made Plato\u2019s Progress awkward reading, since\nit is a work of great scholarship that must cite all the sources, which he\nplunked, parenthetically, in the main text. I was no Plato scholar, so I\ncouldn\u2019t come close to assessing his evidence, but Ryle never wrote a\nboring sentence, and the book inspired me to teach a course at Irvine on\nPlato and his theory of Forms. I even designed a textbook, which included\nall the passages in Plato that seemed relevant to his theory of Forms (with\nrival translations when called for), plus half a dozen controversial articles\non how to interpret them. The task set for students was to frame and defend\na theory of Plato\u2019s developing thought, just as Ryle had done. I found a\nmajor textbook publisher who wanted me to do the project, but I soon\nrealized that I would have to become a classical scholar to do it right. I took\n\fa course in classical Greek, which was fun, but philosophers who are Plato\nand Aristotle experts usually have years of Latin and Greek in high school\nor prep school before they ever get to college. I\u2019d had some Latin in high\nschool, but I realized I\u2019d never catch up to them. Sad to say, I\u2019ve never\nencountered a professor of ancient philosophy who had any interest in\nRyle\u2019s naughty book. Perhaps I will inspire some young scholar to take a\nhard look at it. A rollicking refutation could be a fine start to a career.\n   One of the best features of the new university was that, because there\nwere so many pressing tasks that needed doing, seniority counted for almost\nnothing. I got to participate on major faculty committees, and through these\nactivities I became friends with chemists, physicists, biologists,\nmathematicians, historians, English professors, drama professors,\npsychologists, and computer scientists. We all knew each other quite well,\nand I learned a lot from them. The department chairs were refreshingly\nidealistic, having been lured to Irvine from flourishing careers elsewhere\nwith the promise of building a new university that did things right, but they\nwere also a feisty bunch of academic politicians who fought for power\n(faculty positions they could fill) and for budget. When I moved to Tufts six\nyears later, one of the first things that struck me was how readily the Tufts\nfaculty allowed themselves to be pushed around by the administrators.\nWhere were the operators, the movers and shakers?\n   One of the slickest operators at UCI was James G. March, author with\nHerbert Simon of Organizations (1958), a classic book on organizational\nbehavior, and first dean of the School of Social Sciences. He once asked my\ndear friend James McGaugh, founder of the psychobiology department, for\nhis opinion of a possible hire, and when McGaugh said approvingly, \u201cHe\u2019s\na solid citizen,\u201d Jim March said, \u201cWell, that\u2019s two strikes against him!\u201d\nMarch explained: he figured he had half a dozen years and up to a hundred\nappointments to build a school of social sciences that was of international\nrenown, and he could compete earnestly with every major university for the\n\u201csolid citizens\u201d working their way up the ladders in their fields or he could\nhire every snake charmer and guru and self-styled genius he encountered\nand all he had to do was strike it rich on one or two of these appointments\nand the place would be famous. This was hyperbole, of course, but March\n\fdid hire some dubious characters those first few years, and they eventually\ncaused some serious problems. There was a \u201cprimal scream therapy\u201d\npsychologist who first abused and then treated (for a fee) the students he\nhad abused, and (I\u2019m not making this up) I was once the external examiner\non a PhD dissertation on \u201capplied orgonomy\u201d in which the candidate had\nconstructed one of psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich\u2019s \u201cOrgone\nAccumulators\u201d\u2014a layered wood/metal box that supposedly concentrated\nthe energy of orgasms\u2014which the candidate assured us would bring rain to\nSouthern California in July and August. Fortunately, I left UCI before\nhaving to pass judgment on that dissertation.\n   The wildness of much of what happened in the School of Social Sciences\nwas an open secret on campus, with many professors in other schools\ndismayed by what was going on. One day an undergraduate student of mine\ntold me he\u2019d just learned that Republican senator S. I. Hayakawa (a pop-\npsych linguist turned politician) had student spies reporting to him about the\nvarious shenanigans in Social Sciences. I went immediately to inform UCI\u2019s\nchancellor, Daniel Aldrich, who needed to be on guard against a firestorm\nof criticism that might break any day. He listened carefully and thanked me,\nand that was all he said. A few days later, I read in the campus newspaper\nthat Senator Hayakawa had been invited to give a talk on linguistics by the\nSchool of Social Sciences and had accepted. Hayakawa made his trip to\nUCI and gave his talk and\u2014according to some Social Sciences faculty I\nknew\u2014was taken to a faculty home overlooking Laguna Beach for a party\nafter the talk. He was seated on a couch, given whatever he wanted to drink,\nand was soon joined by a lovely and lively miniskirted graduate student,\nwho proceeded to flirt with him. He fell for it, apparently, since after an\nhour or so she smiled at him, reached under the couch to pick up the tape\nrecorder that was spinning along, and wished him a good day. No\nHayakawa Report on the scandals of the UCI School of Social Sciences\never appeared.\n   Most of the pioneer faculty at UCI were superb, and it was a great\ninterdisciplinary feast for me. Young assistant professors don\u2019t get to know\nmany faculty outside their own departments, except occasionally on\ncommittees, but at UCI we all worked, played, and partied together. In\n\faddition to Jim McGaugh, who was delighted to find a philosopher who had\ncome up with some of the same criticisms of behaviorism that he had\ndeveloped, and who welcomed me in all his seminars, chemist F. Sherwood\n(\u201cSherry\u201d) Rowland, who later won the Nobel Prize for sounding the alarm\non the effect of chlorofluorocarbons on the ozone layer, was the center on\nmy basketball team; Joseph K. Lambert, the deviser of free logic, who had\nonce tried out for the quarterback position on the Chicago Bears, was the\nquarterback on our philosophy department touch-football team; and Edward\nO. Thorp, the mathematician who invented a winning system for blackjack\nand made a fortune, and then another fortune with his book Beat the Dealer\n(1962), was on the crew with me on several racing sailboats. My main\nsailing buddy was Donald Heiney, a professor of comparative literature, aka\nMacDonald Harris, novelist; we sailed on his boat and raced on monohulls\nand the first big ocean-going catamarans.\n    And then there was my friend in the Romance languages department,\nRichard Barrutia, son of Basque immigrants, accordionist, guitarist, and\ncard magician. Dick had financed part of his college education as a\n\u201cmechanic\u201d in Las Vegas. A mechanic is a crooked dealer. Dick would sit\nreading his books in a back room of a casino waiting to be called on by\nmanagement if somebody at one of the blackjack or poker tables needed to\nbe, well, cheated. He taught me the basic moves of \u201cmechanics\u201d and card\nmagic and lent me books from his excellent library of magic books. He\nwould sometimes do something for me that he would never show in public.\nHe once forced a jack of clubs on me at least half a dozen times in a row.\n\u201cPick a card, any card,\u201d he\u2019d say, fanning the deck in front of me. I\u2019d try\neverything\u2014taking the last card in the deck, pulling hard on a card he\nseemed to be holding fast, reaching for one card and then swiftly changing\nto another card, and every time, there was the jack of clubs in my hand. Was\nit perhaps a deck composed of fifty-two jacks of clubs? No\u2014or at least if it\nwas, he was able to switch decks without my seeing it and then let me\nexamine the deck in his hands. It was Dick who introduced me to Ralph\nHull\u2019s great trick, the Tuned Deck, which I\u2019ve used to expose the main flaw\nin David Chalmers\u2019s influential introduction (1995) of what he dubbed \u201cthe\nHard Problem\u201d of consciousness. Even expert magicians were fooled by the\n\fname of the trick, and in particular, by the word \u201cthe\u201d! They thought they\nwere being shown a single new magic trick when in fact they were being\nshown a variety of tricks they already knew. (\u201cThe boys have all looked for\nsomething too hard!\u201d Hull says in his gleeful account of the trick.) Even\nexpert scientists have been fooled by Chalmers\u2019s \u201cthe Hard Problem\u201d into\nthinking that there\u2019s one big mysterious fact that needs explaining, when in\nfact there are hundreds of lesser problems that can be solved without any\nscientific revolutions, and when they are all solved the so-called Hard\nProblem will evaporate.\n    Once we had settled in Irvine, I had to start publishing of course. I began\nsubmitting revised excerpts from my dissertation to philosophy journals,\nand all were turned down. Dozens of them. They were attempts to turn\nphilosophers\u2019 attention away from myopic obsessions with finding a\nlogically foolproof way of stating materialism to challenging facts about\nactual minds, but that was too subversive an exercise for the peer reviewers.\nAt one point I thought I\u2019d landed a fish: Wilfrid Sellars, then editor of\nPhilosophical Studies, wrote a note to me saying that he liked my essay but\nit was unclear on one point, which he invited me to revise. I promptly did so\nand resubmitted, soon getting a note from him saying that now that he saw\nmore clearly what I was saying, he didn\u2019t think my piece was worthy of\npublication. I was crestfallen but had to admire Sellars\u2019s firm grip on\nprinciples. He wasn\u2019t going to let embarrassment stand in the way of his\nphilosophical judgment.\n    I did have one minor triumph. One day Julian Feldman, a pioneer in AI\nand coeditor with Edward Feigenbaum of the first AI anthology, Computers\nand Thought (1963), came bounding into my office and slapped a hefty,\nmimeographed RAND Corporation memo on my desk: Alchemy and\nArtificial Intelligence, by an MIT philosopher, Hubert Dreyfus, which\npurported to be a refutation of the whole idea of artificial intelligence.\n\u201cDan, do you think this guy\u2019s right?\u201d he asked. I read Dreyfus\u2019s essay that\nnight and the next day told Julian that no, I thought Dreyfus had made some\nbig mistakes. \u201cSay what they are!\u201d Julian insisted. \u201cWrite it up!\u201d I did, and\nit led to my first publication, \u201cMachine Traces and Protocol Statements\u201d\n(1968), in the journal Behavioral Science. Dreyfus had claimed that\n\fcomputer programs could never exhibit intuition, and my line of rebuttal\nwas to imagine a computer that solved some problem\u2014any problem, really\n\u2014and if asked how it did it, replied:", "location": 197014}
{"paragraph": "AFTER CHRISTMAS IN BRISTOL, we moved to Oxford and a basement flat in a\nlarge house in Crick Road just north of the Parks, where All Souls College\nhoused their visiting fellows with children. The visiting fellows program\nwas a preemptive response by All Souls to the Franks Commission of\nInquiry in 1965. Lord Oliver Franks, then the provost of Worcester College,\ncleverly composed a searching questionnaire about the policies and\nactivities of the more than three dozen colleges that compose Oxford\nUniversity. These colleges were then almost entirely independent in their\nfinances and governance, and it was an ill-kept secret that many of them\nwere not putting their vast endowments, accrued over centuries, to very\nefficient and equitable use. Franks sent the questionnaire to all the colleges\nasking about how often the fellows met, what they voted on, how they\nadmitted students, how salaries were determined, and so forth, and gave\nthem some months to respond\u2014enough time for the colleges to get their\nhouses in order so that they could truthfully answer Franks\u2019s questions\nwithout too much embarrassment. (This is a tactic all reform-minded deans\nand university presidents should have in their kits.) All Souls College\nfamously has no students. Some but not all of the fellows hold university\nprofessorships, which of course have significant teaching duties, but there\nare no undergraduates to tutor, to house and feed, to advise, so a tenured\nfellow of All Souls could lead a leisurely and comfortable scholarly life\nwith few duties. The visiting fellows program was designed to fend off\npressure from the Franks Commission to admit bothersome young students\nand was quickly instituted by the college to ensure that a steady stream of\nfresh talent from outside the university was present to invigorate and stir up\nthe permanent residents. It worked. To this day there are no undergraduates\nin All Souls College, and only advanced postgraduate fellows.\n\f   In an ancient and tradition-bound university, All Souls College stands\nunrivaled in its hold on the old ways. Leszek Kolakowski, the exiled\ndissident Polish philosopher, was a fellow of All Souls at the time, and once\nwhen he was asked what life in All Souls was like he replied that it was like\n\u201cliving on an island on an island on an island.\u201d Patrick Neill was then the\nwarden, and a story making the rounds that year was that one day Neill was\nwalking through the Houses of Parliament and was spotted by All Souls\nquondam fellow Quintin Hogg, then lord chancellor and dressed in full\nregalia, who called out to him, \u201cNeill! Neill!\u201d whereupon a couple of\nAmerican tourists dutifully knelt. When we were there, the college was still\nrestricted to men only, but there was talk of change. At one formal dinner\nSusan sat next to the warden and gave him quite an earful of remonstration\nabout the absence of female fellows, and she was not alone in her\nsentiments; some weeks later, the following item appeared in the weekly\nOxford Times (February 9, 1979), under the headline GIRLS ALLOWED:", "location": 363959}
{"paragraph": "I N  CONTENT AND CONSCIOUSNESS, ONE OF MY EMBARRASSING mistakes was\nbutchering Quine\u2019s example \u201cGiorgione was so-called because of his size.\u201d\nQuine\u2019s point was to analyze cases in which a word, in this case\n\u201cGiorgione,\u201d is both used (to refer to the painter) and mentioned (as a\nname) in the same breath, and I, overexplaining this, wrote that \u201cGiorgione\u201d\nwas a diminutive, meaning Little George, when in fact it means Big\nGeorge. I had thought that since in French a crouton is a little crust and a\ncarafon is half a carafe, there was a similar pattern in Italian. Wrong. A\nlittle knowledge can be a dangerous thing. This mistake led to an amusing\ncorrespondence among the Columbia philosopher of art Arthur Danto and\nQuine and me. Danto, noting my error, went on to say that Quine was\nwrong as well, quoting Vasari as saying Giorgione was so called because of\nthe greatness of his soul, not his body, and Quine rebutted this with some\nscholarship of his own. Quine was hardly ever caught out on factual errors,\nespecially about language.\n    In later years, I have often thought of my Tufts colleague George Smith\nas Giorgione\u2014Big George, though I have never called him that out loud\u2014\nnot because of his size but because of his greatness in several other regards.\nHe is a philosopher who is also an engineer (with no engineering degree)\n\fand an international expert on turbines, flying all over the world to inspect\ndamaged turbines and render his opinion on the causes of their failure. He is\nalso a world-renowned scholar on Newton\u2019s Principia, a former acting\ndirector of the Dibner Institute for the History of Science and Technology at\nMIT, a logician, a computer scientist, a former basketball coach, an expert\non Noam Chomsky\u2019s linguistics, and one of the greatest teachers I have\never encountered.\n    How on earth, one might ask, could somebody acquire so many different\nkinds of expertise? It all goes back to his childhood in Cincinnati, when he\nwas identified by General Electric as a supersmart high schooler and\nenlisted in a special program for gifted kids. There\u2014in the 1950s\u2014he\nlearned to program computers from the bottom up, in machine language.\nWhile at Yale majoring in philosophy and mathematics (and studying with\nWilfrid Sellars among others, before Pittsburgh raided Yale to set up their\nown great department), he worked part-time at Pratt & Whitney in East\nHartford, using his computer expertise to write a program for analyzing jet\nengine turbines. This program, VIBLAD, enlarged and updated by George\nas VIPACK, was in use around the world for many years. After Yale, he\ntried Harvard\u2019s PhD program in philosophy, but he dropped out and devoted\nhimself to engineering for a decade or so, assisting in various projects at\nMIT\u2014with Chomsky, with political scientists (e.g., Hayward Alker), with\nothers\u2014before writing some logic papers (on Saul Kripke\u2019s modal logic)\nthat were deemed sufficient for a PhD in philosophy in the MIT Department\nof Linguistics and Philosophy. He volunteered to coach inner-city kids in a\nbasketball league in his spare time and did so well at this that several NBA\nplayers credit him with getting them on track. He went into the philosophy\njob market before he finished his PhD, applying only to Tufts, since he\nwanted to stay in Boston, and we grabbed him to teach logic and\nphilosophy of science, probably the wisest hiring move any philosophy\ndepartment has ever made. His logic course, perhaps the most demanding\nintroductory logic course in the country, was famous among students,\nbecause he knew how to inspire them to perform beyond what they thought\nthey could do\u2014the basketball coach getting his players to \u201cleave it all on\nthe court.\u201d He allowed the students to spend as much time as they needed\n\fon his final exam, and some of them would labor away for five or six hours\nbefore handing in their blue books.\n    In 1982, Time magazine gave its \u201cMan [sic] of the Year\u201d award to the\npersonal computer. Suddenly the parents of incoming Tufts students wanted\ntheir children to learn all about computers, and maybe major in computer\nscience. Tufts didn\u2019t even have a department of computer science then.\nThere were about half a dozen computer scientists on the faculty, three or\nfour located in the math department, and a few more in electrical\nengineering. They assembled a department but didn\u2019t want to teach a large\nintroductory course because they had their hands full dealing with the flood\nof students already initiated into the mysteries of computers who were\ntaking advanced courses. Tufts asked George Smith and me, from\nphilosophy, and two mathematicians who were computer savvy, to team-\nteach an introduction to computer science. George, with his customary\nenergy and organizational skills, took charge. He didn\u2019t just inspire students\nto throw themselves into a project, he inspired his colleagues, and soon I\nhad dropped or postponed various philosophical projects to help him create\nthis course. We wanted it to be intellectually substantial\u2014not just a skills\ncourse teaching the students how to turn on a computer, do word\nprocessing, and such things. The students in the course were, with few\nexceptions, not thinking of having careers involving computers, and in fact\nmany were seriously computerphobic\u2014as many people were back in those\ndays at the dawn of the personal-computer age. But we wanted them to\ncome away from the course knowing the basic theory of how computers\nworked their magic, how to write simple programs, and how computer\nprograms worked\u2014graphics, spreadsheets\u2014along with other topics, such\nas AI. They learned about Alan Turing and Turing machines, but also about\nregister machines, a more intuitive kind of utterly simple computer that the\nlogician Hao Wang had invented in 1957. They also learned about the basic\nvon Neumann architecture (shared by probably all the dozens of computer\nchips you have in your house, your car, your phone, your television set,\nyour oven, \u2026).\n    What programming language should we teach them? I suggested Logo,\nthe creation of Seymour Papert at MIT\u2019s AI lab, a blissfully user-friendly\n\flanguage designed for six-year-olds, who could readily learn how to get the\nLogo \u201cturtle\u201d to move around on the screen, drawing lines and performing\nmany other simple and visible tasks. It was perfect! Tufts freshmen who\nwere scared to touch a computer were soon vying with one another to draw\nflowers and vehicles and buildings and all sorts of other surprising things.\nLogo is an \u201cinterpreted\u201d language, not a \u201ccompiled\u201d language, so you get to\nsee the results of each line of programming as soon as you compose it.\nLogo is also a remarkably powerful language, basically Lisp for kids, with\nfull recursion, able to treat code as data and data as code, an elegant\nthinking tool of unlimited power once you start playing around with it. We\nalso taught the students the elements of Pascal, a grown-up\u2019s language, just\nso that they could get a feeling for how serious programs are constructed,\ndebugged, and executed.\n    The first year, George did some brilliant chalk talks, teaching about the\nvon Neumann architecture, with its instruction cycle and accumulator, its\nstacks and program counters. One of our teaching assistants, an\nundergraduate computer science major, Steve Barney, was inspired by this\npedagogy, and over the summer, with some guidance from George, he\ncreated an animated simulation of a simple, stripped-down von Neumann\nmachine (a twelve-bit machine with 256 memory registers and a reduced\ninstruction set), which he called Aesop. It was fabulous. You could program\nit easily and watch your lines of code land in the memory and later get\npulled one at a time into the instruction register, where they got executed,\nchanging the contents in the accumulator. Ta-DAA! George also gave\nlectures introducing register machines and teaching the students how to\nprogram them. I had never even heard of register machines before that\ncourse, and they fascinated me, so, inspired by Steve Barney\u2019s creation, I\nset out to create a simulated register machine in Logo, with the turtle\ntrundling around putting beans in boxes, taking beans out of boxes, and\nbranching to another instruction when a box was empty. I wanted to show\nthe students that Logo was not just for drawing amazing spiral patterns and\nspaceships. These simulations, especially Steve\u2019s Aesop, were so effective\nthat when we used them in the class the next year, we had to drastically\n\fupgrade the exams in the course; almost everybody in the class would have\nscored 100 if we gave them the test from the previous year.\n   George and I decided that we shouldn\u2019t stop there. We both knew Eric\nWanner, who had been in the AI lab at MIT but had moved to New York to\nbecome a vice president and program officer at the Sloan Foundation, and\nwe got ourselves invited to present a proposal to the foundation to fund\nsomething we called the Curricular Software Studio. Our idea was that in\nmany fields there were what might be called pedagogical bottlenecks\u2014\ndifficult concepts that confused many students\u2014and many of these\nbottlenecks, we thought, could be opened up with imaginative software. At\nthe time, there were professors around the country in many fields who, with\nvarious levels of computer agility, had created software for use in their\nclasses. These worked but were usually less than polished. There were also\nsoftware firms that were turning out educational software in various fields,\nand these were quite professionally packaged but often weak on content.\nWe proposed to be the matchmakers who brought content experts\u2014\nprofessors\u2014with no computer skills together with programmers who were\nnot content experts, to form creative partnerships that would design robust,\ncrisp, and accurate software to awaken and then discipline the students\u2019\nimaginations.\n   One of my roles in this project was metaphor maven, and I came up with\nseveral winners. We called these promised programs imagination\nprostheses, and I contrasted two ways machines can make us powerful: the\nbulldozer way (you can move mountains, but you\u2019re still a ninety-eight-\npound weakling) and the Nautilus machine way (you use the machine to\nmake yourself stronger). We proposed Nautilus machines for the mind,\ndesigned to instill and enhance fluent imagination and comprehension in the\nuser, not just provide answers to questions while leaving you in the dark.\nGeorge and I took Steve Barney\u2019s Aesop program to our meeting in a\nconference room at the Sloan Foundation, where a group including some\nmajor computer scientists watched as we gave our demo. At one point, a\ncomputer scientist stopped me in mid-demo and said, angrily, \u201cI know that\npicture,\u201d pointing at the computer screen where Aesop\u2019s CPU and memory\nwere chugging along. I thought for an awful moment that he was accusing\n\fus of plagiarizing the image or something like that, but he went on, after\nsputtering a little, \u201cIt took me years to get that picture in my head, and you\nsay you\u2019re going to give it to your students in ten minutes?\u201d \u201cYes, that\u2019s the\nidea, exactly.\u201d\n    We got a modest start-up grant from the Sloan Foundation and promptly\nset up shop as the Curricular Software Studio, hiring Steve Barney and\nanother good young programmer to be our original hackers. We started\nworking on several projects at once: a population-genetics program called\nGeneWright (in honor of Sewall Wright, cofounder of the field) and the\nSpace Time Microscope, of which Aesop was the lowest magnification of a\ncomputer, about ten times larger and running about a million times more\nslowly than the PC it ran on, with other \u201clenses\u201d that zoomed in on the\ninstruction register, showing how op codes are like area codes leading to\ncircuits that perform specific operations such as addition or multiplication,\nor zoomed in on the adder circuit, showing how it had a half adder inside it,\nor zoomed in even closer so that you could see how a flip-flop was\ncomposed of logic gates. In other words, you could see just how the logic\ngates you\u2019d heard about were put together to store bits, perform arithmetical\nprocesses, execute instructions.\n    Another role of mine was to solicit ideas for further imagination\nprostheses. My favorite was one inspired by a problem Stephen Jay Gould\ntold me he was having with his Harvard students (back when we were\nfriends). He wanted them to learn how to read, and draw, stratigraphy\ndiagrams, those geological cross sections showing layers of sediment,\nintrusions of magma, fractures and folds, and the like. He would give them\nproblem sets that required them to draw diagrams, and the best students\nreadily drew the diagrams but then let others in the class trace or copy their\ndiagrams (yes, even Harvard students have been known to cheat on\nassignments). \u201cI can solve your problem, Steve,\u201d I said cockily, and I\nhelped Steve Barney and Robert (\u201cBert\u201d) Reuss, a geology professor at\nTufts, create Slice, a drawing program that, instead of allowing you to draw\nsquares and circles and arrows and fill them with color, allowed you only to\n\u201cpaint\u201d using geological primitives, like deposit a sedimentary layer of x, or\nfold at y, or erode to level z. A list of your actions scrolled down on the side\n\fof the screen, and if you got some steps out of order, or with the wrong\nparameters, you could edit these actions and the program would redraw\nyour diagram. \u201cWith this program, Steve,\u201d I told him, \u201cyou can just draw a\nstratigraphy diagram with it, hide your actions lists, and challenge your\nstudents to draw the same diagram with the program. If they can do it, they\nunderstand the principles.\u201d\n    We made a good start on Slice but never finished it, sad to say, for\nvarious reasons\u2014chief of which was that the original PCs just didn\u2019t have\nthe graphics power needed to do what we wanted them to do quickly\nenough. You can\u2019t have students waiting five minutes for the program to\nredraw their diagram. Today, using the superfast graphics engines\ndeveloped largely by video-game companies, you could do a fantastic three-\ndimensional Slice program that would allow students to order up an\norogeny (the creation of a mountain range), make \u201croadcuts\u201d at any angle\non its slopes, and watch the erosion of millions of years do its work in\nseconds, a prospect that makes my mouth water. I had a version of the\nprototype Slice program on my PC at home while we were working on it,\nand my son, Peter, then about eleven, got fascinated with it and spent hours\ntrying to write \u201cPD,\u201d his initials, in folded, fractured strata in a diagram. He\nwas learning fundamental relationships between geological events without\nany \u201cstudying\u201d; it was a game with rules and outcomes, and it riveted his\nattention.\n    One day I took Mark DeVoto, my old college friend in the music\ndepartment, to lunch to see if I could interest him in creating an imagination\nprosthesis for teaching difficult points in harmony theory or composition.\nWe brainstormed for several happy hours and then decided, with a laugh,\nthat there already was such a machine, ideally suited both visually and\naurally, for the task. It\u2019s called a piano! A piano doesn\u2019t just allow you to\nplay multiple notes at once, in any order you choose, but it gives you two\nrelated but different visual representations: the keyboard and the music staff\npaper in front of you. It\u2019s a most user-friendly instrument, which any child\ncan start playing, but what you can do with those keys is virtually\nunbounded, and you don\u2019t have to worry about tuning each note as you play\nit. So now I had another metaphor to explain what we were doing at the\n\fCurricular Software Studio: we were designing concept pianos that anyone\ncan play.\n   After a few years, we had created several useful\u2014if not always thrilling\n\u2014programs, and were in touch with people around the country who were\nalso doing such things. We held a national workshop, drawing in the\nleaders, and realized, sad to say, that the computer world was changing too\nfast for us to keep up with it. We had decided to go with PCs (back before\nWindows was created, we were using the DOS operating system) while\nothers were using Macs. We would have to keep updating our existing\nproducts to take advantage of the new, faster models of personal computers,\nand there were miles of red tape to get in place in order to get proper license\nagreements and the like. Jon Barwise and John Etchemendy, philosophers at\nStanford, had created Tarski\u2019s World (on first-order logic) and Turing\u2019s\nWorld (on Turing machines), and Judah Schwartz at MIT had his wonderful\nGeometric Supposer (which allowed you to make Euclidean constructions\non a computer as a source of candidate theorems to prove), and while these\nwere much admired and used for a few years, by the mid-\u201990s we had all\nrun out of steam and money. Too bad, since there are still pedagogical\nbottlenecks that could be opened up by high-quality software\u2014a few that\ntantalize me are color vision, going from the physics of photons to neural\nrepresentations; enhanced versions of Richard Dawkins\u2019s elegant Blind\nWatchmaker software for exploring evolution; and, of course, learning to\nvisualize how greenhouse gases lead, indirectly, to droughts, tornadoes, and\nother destructive weather.\n   What about computer prostheses for doing philosophy? Aside from the\nadmirable programs by Barwise and Etchemendy, which bring logic to life,\nthis has not\u2014to my knowledge\u2014been a fruitful area. Philosophers have a\nlong way to go in catching up with scientists, and until the recent\nPowerPoint revolution, few philosophers even used diagrams to illustrate\ntheir points in lectures or conference talks\u2014rather like novelists who are\nopposed to illustrations in principle. But times are changing. I have been\narguing for years that AI research provides excellent tools for both\ndisciplining and enhancing the imagination of philosophers, whose thought\nexperiments (or intuition pumps, as I call them) are often riddled with gaps\n\fand traps that would be discovered by anybody who set out to build a\ncomputer model to demonstrate the claimed effect. AI can be seen to be a\nkind of computer-aided thought-experimental discipline, trying out\ntempting simplifications and discovering awkward problems along the way.\nThe challenge of turning \u201cvaporware\u201d (hand-waving promises and nudges)\ninto running software is a humbling learning experience for philosophers,\nbut it has also yielded some impressive results.\n   For a number of years, Steve Barney, with encouragement and advice\nfrom me, worked with Joan King, a professor of neuroanatomy at Tufts\nmedical school, on TUBE, the Tufts University Brain Explorer, which did\nfor the brain what the London Tube map famously does for the geography\nof the rail lines under London: preserving connectivity while ironing out all\nthe wrinkles. We wanted this to be a three-dimensional brain-modeling\nsystem that permitted you to \u201cinflate\u201d the wrinkled, grooved cerebral cortex\ninto the highly regular layers that have been shrink-wrapped into the skull,\nselectively stretching and smoothing the connections and doing a similar\nschematic rendering of the other parts of the brain\u2014the cerebellum, the\nthalamus, and all the rest. Steve made a good start on this, but in the\nintervening decades others have caught up and far surpassed us in the art\u2014\nand it is an art\u2014of diagramming the brain so that it suggests hypotheses\nabout how it works and why it\u2019s arranged the way it is.\n   All this grew out of George Smith\u2019s boyhood introduction to computers\nback in Cincinnati, and to this day I would say that the introductory\ncomputer course I taught with him was the most rewarding teaching and\nlearning experience of my academic life. In second place would be another\ncourse we taught together: a seminar on Descartes\u2019s science and philosophy\n(on which George is, of course, an expert). George led me and the class\nthrough a fascinating deep dive into the science of Descartes\u2019s day and the\nrevealing controversies that arose from his Meditations. This provoked me\nto write my one essay of historical scholarship, \u201cDescartes\u2019s Argument\nfrom Design,\u201d unearthing Descartes\u2019s surprising version of the Argument\nfrom Design for the existence of God in his Third Meditation. After\nteaching the Meditations for decades, I finally made sense of his\nsurprisingly obscure and disappointing argument, an embarrassment that I\n\fhad hurried past dozens of times. I don\u2019t think his contemporaries\nappreciated what he was trying to do, and he himself, I think, had only a\nsketchy idea of how his argument worked, but with hindsight we can say\nthat his argument was\u2014or should have been\u2014persuasive until Darwin\ncame along to overturn his perspective.", "location": 436765}
{"paragraph": "T  HIS BOOK IS THE WORK OF MANY MINDS.       FIRST, ALL the people whose\ninteractions with me are recounted in this book deserve to be considered\ncoauthors of sorts (like the hundreds of authors on physics papers these\ndays, none of them responsible for residual errors that remain). No doubt a\nfew errors will still be found, in spite of the wonderful editing, first by Sara\nLippincott, and then by Sarah Johnson and Brendan Curry at Norton. So\nmany typos and thinkos caught and removed! Luca Del Baldo looked hard\ninto my mind and not just at my face before painting his portrait of me on\nthe cover.

{"paragraph": "The BPhil, which I had signed up for, was a relatively new degree in\nphilosophy, designed primarily for students from America, Canada,\n\fAustralia, and New Zealand. Meant to be a worthy substitute for a PhD, it\nwas an intense two-year program culminating in a horrific two weeks\nduring which you handed in a dissertation and took three daunting written\nexams. If you failed at any of these tasks, you were out, finished, no second\nchances or retakes. (About a third of the BPhil students back then flunked\nand left with no diploma. The degree has since been modified, trading in the\nexaminations for a series of submitted essays.) In England at that time, and\nparticularly at Oxford, you could obtain a university position without any\ngraduate degree. After receiving a \u201cfirst\u201d (summa cum laude in America) on\nyour bachelor\u2019s degree, you could hang around for another year without any\nparticular duties or examinations and obtain a master\u2019s degree, which was\nthe only \u201cadvanced\u201d degree most Oxford dons could put after their names\n(MA Oxon). (There were perhaps eighty philosophy dons\u2014college tutors\u2014\nat Oxford then, but only three were professors. At the time, Grice,\nStrawson, Wiggins, Quinton, Anscombe, Foot, Murdoch, the Warnocks\n[Geoffrey and Mary], \u2026 were all just dons.)\n   All BPhil students had one of the three philosophy professors as their\nsupervisor, and I was assigned to Professor Ryle. Knowing my weakness as\nan exam writer, I was worried. I figured I could easily write the rather short\ndissertation (thirty thousand words) but would almost certainly fail at least\none of the exams. Still, I started the program, because working with Ryle\nhad been my first choice. His 1949 book, The Concept of Mind, was, to my\nway of thinking, the best example of ordinary-language philosophy, with its\nlively, even swashbuckling, attack on \u201cthe ghost in the machine\u201d\u2014Ryle\u2019s\ndisrespectful term for Descartes\u2019s great error (which I was still hoping to\nexpose). After a few months of weekly meetings with Ryle, I confessed to\nhim that I was sure I would fail one of the exams and asked if I could\nswitch to the BLitt degree, which required just a dissertation and was\nregarded as a sort of consolation prize, a proof that one had been a student\nat Oxford. I would then go to Berkeley for my doctorate. \u201cYou might have\nto settle for a BLitt, but why not try for the DPhil?\u201d Ryle replied. The DPhil\nrequired only a dissertation and a minimum of two years as a student, but\nyou had to be especially recommended into the program by a professor.\nRyle said he would try to get me accepted! (I later learned that he was so\n\finfluential then in Oxford that this was a sure thing. I also learned, years\nlater, that Ryle had been one of the chief architects of the BPhil, which I\nhad candidly opined to him was unacceptably inhumane. I also learned\u2014\nnot from him\u2014that it was he who had forwarded my application to\nHertford College when his college, Magdalen, turned me down. He had\ntaken this unusual step because of Quine\u2019s strong letter of recommendation.\nLucky me.)\n    Susan landed a part-time job at the Bodleian Library helping to catalog\nillustrations in medieval manuscripts. What a treat! The great leather-bound\nparchment books would be carefully laid out on a table and Susan\u2019s task\nwas to identify the items pictured: animals, flowers, trees, farmers and their\ntools, saints, buildings, food, and so forth. She soon learned to distinguish\nhundreds of ancient items, and today if you want to see representations of\nfish or dogs or unicorns or scribes or princes in the twelfth century, you can\nlook them up thanks in part to Susan\u2019s work. Her boss was a classic English\nlibrarian, wearing his scholarship lightly but devoted to his project. He\ntaught Susan a lot about English life from the Middle Ages to the mid-\ntwentieth century, introducing us, for instance, to the practice of putting a\nlittle sherry from the decanter into your soup.\n    You didn\u2019t \u201ctake courses\u201d at Oxford; there were lectures and seminars\nscheduled, but the dons and professors who presented them didn\u2019t take\nattendance, didn\u2019t typically even get to know the names of the students, and\ndidn\u2019t examine them or assign term papers. I sampled many of these and\nstayed with most I sampled: Strawson on Kant and Grice on meaning were\nones I particularly remember, but I had great difficulty in Grice\u2019s seminar.\nHe spoke very slowly, with lots of ums interposed: \u201cThis factor um, um, um\n\u2026 um, um, um \u2026 has um often been mistaken um, um for \u2026\u201d I\u2019d\nsometimes mentally wander off and think my own untethered thoughts,\nonly to be brought back sharply when I noticed that he had just finished\nsaying something very interesting\u2014but what? I once logged words against\nums for a few minutes; the ums won by a small margin. And then there were\nA. J. Ayer\u2019s elegant lectures on epistemology. All the American BPhil\nstudents attended, of course, and we mostly tried to be modest and quiet,\nbut one of our countrymen, Peter Unger, was an exception. He would rise\n\ffrom his seat and bellow in his New York accent, \u201cAah, Professor Ayer, I\nthink you\u2019re all wrong about that! You\u2019re making a rather obvious error \u2026\u201d\nwhile the rest of us Yanks cringed. But Ayer enjoyed Unger\u2019s sometimes\noutrageous challenges, and it did make for edgy entertainment on occasion.\n    At that time in Oxford, I was so insecure that I could readily entertain\nthe idea that I was just not smart enough to be a philosopher, since so often\nin discussion I\u2019d get snared by some clever chap who could counterexample\nme to death, cleverly picking up escape hatches and ambiguities in my own\nwords that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Years later I cured myself of that anxiety when\nI was a visiting professor at Harvard and had a heart-to-heart talk with\nRobert Nozick, one of the smartest, swiftest philosophers I\u2019ve ever\nencountered. Bob confessed to me that his biggest problem as a philosopher\nwas that he wasn\u2019t just a quick study\u2014he was too quick a study. Show him\na new argument, or a whole new research area, such as probability theory or\nrecursive function theory or free logic, and he\u2019d get it almost instantly. \u201cBut\nthe folks who don\u2019t get it without a struggle, who plod along anxiously,\ntrying to avoid mistakes\u2014they\u2019re often the ones who see the problems that\nI glide by without noticing.\u201d\n    Getting approved for the DPhil was liberating, and I still had Ryle as my\nsupervisor. His book The Concept of Mind along with Wittgenstein\u2019s\nPhilosophical Investigations were the bibles among many of the graduate\nstudents. Ordinary-language philosophy was the reigning fashion of the day\nthroughout the English-speaking philosophical world, and Oxford was\nMecca for ordinary-language philosophers. The graduate-student pilgrims\nwho arrived in Oxford to take the cloth were devout but (as usual for\ngraduate students) a little out-of-date. The heyday of ordinary-language\nphilosophy was over, since Oxford\u2019s J. L. Austin had died in 1960. Paul\nGrice and Peter Strawson were doing very interesting work, but it was\nalmost buried in the mountain of second-rate fussing that was all that was\nleft of ordinary-language philosophy. It was a period of mannered modesty,\nwhere no question was too picayune to deserve a meandering, informal\nsurvey of \u201cwhat we would say\u201d about forgetting to do something or telling a\ndream or ignoring somebody. This was all inspired by a few incisive\nexamples concocted by Austin, who once wrote: \u201cLet us distinguish\n\fbetween acting intentionally and acting deliberately or on purpose, as far as\nthis can be done by attending to what language can teach us.\u201d One graduate\nstudent wrote a dissertation on the ordinary meaning of the word \u201cbottle.\u201d\nHow tall does a jar have to be to count as a bottle? Is an inkwell a bottle? A\nbottle can be made out of plastic or even leather; can a bottle be made out\nof metal? Then there was the worship of St. Ludwig. I can remember a\ndrinks party of graduate students who all had their copies of Philosophical\nInvestigations with them, and somebody remarked at how tattered and well\nused they all looked. A competition ensued over whose copy was most\nthumbed, and when the winner was decided the second-place finisher one-\nupped everyone by insisting that this was his second copy; he\u2019d had to\nreproduce all his marginalia from his first copy, which had utterly fallen\napart. This almost religious atmosphere didn\u2019t smother my appreciation of\nWittgenstein, but it did lead me into a more iconoclastic interpretation of his\nwork.\n   Danny Daniels (Charles B. Daniels, 1935\u20132012) was another American\nwho talked his way into the DPhil program. There were, in fact, at least four\nof us: Dennis Stampe and Peter Unger were the other two. Danny was a\njoyous original, a rebel, an entertainer. Was he also a con man? There were\ntimes when I wondered. He said he had been an \u201cice man\u201d back in America\n\u2014with no account of his undergraduate studies\u2014and he seemed blithely\nunconcerned about his lack of preparation for a doctorate in philosophy.\nHow he managed to get admitted to the DPhil program was a mystery. He\ndidn\u2019t seem to spend much time studying philosophy. I wasn\u2019t a habitu\u00e9 of\npubs, but whenever I did drop in to the Turf Tavern, there he\u2019d be, holding\nforth amusingly about his many adventures. There were the East European\ntwin sisters, both princesses of some kind, who were competing for Danny\u2019s\nhand in marriage, and there was his time in Spain learning how to make\nguitars and how to play them (I never heard him play). While in Spain, he\u2019d\nreceived notice from the draft board reclassifying him 1-A, but he\u2019d heard\nthat you got a medical deferment if you didn\u2019t have both big toes, so he\ntalked a shady Spanish doctor into amputating one of them. The doctor\nmade a mess of it, and Danny had to fly back to the States to save his leg.\nThis left him with a painful neuroma, he said, and then he learned that there\n\fwas no exemption for not having a big toe\u2014but there was for having a\npainful stump; the neuroma kept him out of Vietnam. I decided I just had to\ncall him on that one and asked him to remove his shoe. He graciously\nacceded and, sure enough, he had no big toe on that foot.\n   He got a job teaching economics to airmen at the US Strategic Air\nCommand base at Brize Norton, a few miles west of Oxford, in the\nextension program run by the University of Maryland. I asked him if he\u2019d\nmajored in economics as an undergraduate, and he said he hadn\u2019t; he\u2019d\nnever taken an economics course, but he was managing to stay a week or so\nahead of the students using the textbook provided. This activity gave him\naccess to the PX (the tax-free \u201cpost exchange\u201d supermarket, where the US\nmilitary and their families shopped), from which each week he purchased\ngallons of liquor, cartons of cigarettes, and American favorites such as\npeanut butter, which he then resold to Americans and others in Oxford. One\nday he knocked on our door and said excitedly that he needed help: He\u2019d\njust accepted a job tutoring students in Christ Church College on the British\nempiricists. What was the problem? \u201cWho were the British empiricists?\u201d he\nasked. The portrait of John Locke, along with Hume and Berkeley, the most\nfamous of the British empiricists, hung prominently in the dining hall of\nChrist Church, where Locke studied medicine in the eighteenth century. I\ngave Danny a half-hour summary of British empiricism and a short list of\nbooks to read, and he went off happily to tutor his students.\n   All students were required to wear gowns to lectures and tutorials and\nmeals, either the short black \u201ccommoner\u2019s\u201d gown, a short vest with long\ntassles, or the long flowing \u201cscholar\u2019s\u201d gown\u2014roughly your basic black\nchoir robe\u2014or, as graduate students, a longer version of the commoner\u2019s\ngown. For special ceremonies such as examinations, one also was obliged\nto wear \u201csubfusc\u201d (dark trousers and jacket, white shirt, and white bow tie).\nGowns are now required only at such ceremonial occasions. Since I was\nmarried, I never lived in Hertford College or even had tutorials there. All\nmy tutorials were with Ryle in Magdalen. I did attend a few dinners and\nlunches in Hertford, just to show my face and get the occasional mail in my\nmailbox. At that time, Hertford was known as the haven of nouveau riche\nsons (no women then) whose parents\u2019 connections and perhaps donations\n\fhad secured their entry to Oxford. It did not do very well in the academic\nstandings, but its High Table (where the dons ate) was well regarded, as was\nits wine cellar. Among the undergraduates were a few entertaining sports\nwho quickly befriended me because I had a Frisbee, which they had never\nseen, and we often threw the Frisbee around in the Hertford courtyard or the\nParks after lunch. They all wanted Frisbees, so I asked my mother to send\nme a package of them, and soon I was deluged with requests. Danny\nDaniels and I attempted to set up something like a distributorship with\nWham-O, the American manufacturer, but they didn\u2019t respond at all. Danny\nfound a plastics factory in Berkshire that would pirate them for about two\nshillings apiece (about twenty-eight cents American then) and we pondered\nthe prospect of engaging in a lucrative bit of industrial crime, but I\u2019m happy\nto say we dropped the idea. Oh, the paths not taken!\n    Oxford at that time was still remarkably full of antique traditions and\npolicies. Students\u2014even graduate students\u2014who lived in college were\nrequired to be inside their colleges by eleven o\u2019clock, when all the great\ngates and doors were locked. The next morning, if your scout (the man who\ncleaned your room, including your tea dishes and glasses, made your bed,\nand would even shine your shoes) found you absent, he was obliged to\ninform the head porter in the lodge, who would tell the dean, who \u2026 But\neach college had an ill-kept secret about how to climb in after hours. At\nMagdalen, for example, there was a lamppost next to the college wall in\nLongwall Street that had a vicious-looking ring of downward-pointing\nspikes attached about seven feet off the ground. They looked vicious, but\nyou could grab them (unless you were very short, in which case you\u2019d need\nan accomplice) and use them to pull yourself up on the lamppost high\nenough to get an arm and then a leg and then the rest of you over the top of\nthe wall, through one of the crenellations. Once over, there was a short drop\nto the corrugated metal roof of the bicycle shed and thence a shorter drop to\nthe ground.\n    The currency was still pounds, shillings, and pence, but in two years I\nsaw only one shilling coin in circulation\u2014pennies and tuppennies and\nthruppenny bits and two bobs (also known as florins) and half crowns, but\nno shillings. Why not? Because many people, especially students, had coin-\n\fmetered gas heaters in their flats that took only shillings, so shillings were\nhoarded, and whenever the gasman came to collect, you made sure to have\npounds and coins to exchange for the shillings he unloaded from the coin\nbox. One of the flats we looked at before finding our Beaumont Street gem\nwas in Park Town, in North Oxford, and when we noticed the absence of\nany refrigerator in the tiny kitchen, the huge Miss Marplesque landlady\nshowed us the wire cage outside the kitchen window on the north side,\nwhich would keep milk and butter and cheese cool, she said, adding in her\ndeep rumbling voice, \u201cAnd if you have a particularly large joint, you can\nkeep it in my cold north larder.\u201d (She was talking about a roast, not a reefer,\nof course.)\n    There were three cinemas in Oxford. The ABC showed Hollywood films\nand major films from the British studios. La Scala, in Walton Street,\nspecialized in foreign-language art films, and the Moulin Rouge in\nHeadington had a mixed bag of offerings. Susan and I often went to the\nmovies and would see a bad movie if there wasn\u2019t a halfway decent one\nshowing\u2014at \u201cthree and six\u201d (three shillings and sixpence, about fifty cents)\na bargain even then. One evening I called La Scala to ask what was playing,\nand the young woman who answered said she didn\u2019t know. \u201cWell, please\njust step out and look on the marquee,\u201d I suggested. She did and came back\nto tell me that she couldn\u2019t read it, because it was in a foreign language.\n\u201cOh I bet you can do it. Give it a try,\u201d I urged, and she did, returning in a\nfew seconds to say, \u201cOh I did try, sir, and you\u2019re right! I could read it. It\u2019s a\nFrench movie About a Souffl\u00e9!\u201d (The great Jean-Luc Godard film\nBreathless, in French: \u00c0 bout de souffle.)\n    One of the books I purchased that year was The Jenguin Pennings, a\ncollection of the funny \u201cOddly Enough\u201d columns that Paul Jennings wrote\nweekly for The Observer. The one that inspired me most was \u201cWare, Wye,\nWatford,\u201d which turned the names of towns and cities into nouns, verbs,\nand adjectives. (\u201cI\u2019m feeling a little wembley today,\u201d and \u201cIf \u2019tis dunstable,\nhe\u2019ll do it, milord,\u201d and \u201cIn his will he left me nobbut a kenilworth!\u201d) It was\nsurely the trigger for my Philosophical Lexicon, of which more later. I spent\nmany hours in Blackwell\u2019s bookstore, which had and no doubt still has the\nlargest philosophy-book selection in the world. One day when I was\n\fbrowsing, I struck up a conversation with an older American who was\nperusing the same shelves. He said he was a philosophy professor from\nYale, but something about his manner suggested to me that he was actually\nan American tourist who was trying to have a little fun pulling the wool\nover my eyes. \u201cWhere are you staying?\u201d I asked, and he replied after a little\npause, \u201cOh, in Balliol,\u201d which was the college right down the street. I\nfigured he\u2019d made that reply up in the moment. I engaged him in\nphilosophical discussion, and everything he said convinced me that he was\nan impostor; I\u2019d struck paydirt, and I remember going home to supper and\ntelling Susan of the fun I\u2019d had leading this tourist on, never revealing to\nhim that I knew the truth.

There is a variety of obsessive-compulsive disorder,\nsometimes called existential obsessive-compulsive disorder, the chief\nsymptom of which is an inordinate concern with philosophical questions,\nand some of these people, suffering from logorrhea, write book-length\ndiscourses on their discoveries. I used to receive these several times a year,\nand I called the senders triangle people, because their well-boxed reams of\nnonsense typically had an equilateral triangle on the first page, with the\ncorners labeled with any three of the big words: Existence, Time, Energy,\nSpace, Love, Infinity, Consciousness, Will, \u2026 Early in my career, I tried to\nread, or at least skim, these unwanted presents and write the authors little\npersonal notes, but eventually I realized that even the most tepid and barely\npolite encouragement could open floodgates better left locked. For a while,\nI sent some of these typescripts to a Boston neuropsychiatrist who was\ncollecting examples for a study he was conducting. I don\u2019t know if anything\ncame of it.\n    I must admit that it is sometimes difficult to tell whether such a\nproduction is actually a genuinely deep and novel philosophical treatise. A\n\funiversity press once sent me a very long manuscript by a senior researcher\nin cybernetics to review for publication, and since I was being paid for this\nlabor, I buckled up and read the thing as best I could and arrived at a firm\nopinion of its nuttiness only when I discovered that whole chapters in part 3\nwere almost word-for-word copies of chapters in part 1 with minor\nvariations. I have abandoned a few other manuscripts without arriving at a\nverdict, willing to risk the fate of being damned by history as the\nuncomprehending Rejector of a Great Work. Life is short.\n   One day back in 1979, I received a manila envelope with a longish\ntypescript and a self-introductory note from a philosopher at the University\nof Connecticut named Ruth Millikan, who acknowledged that both she and\nher colleagues thought her work was \u201chopelessly maverick.\u201d Fair warning,\nbut I found her work a bold attempt to apply evolutionary insights to vexing\nissues in the philosophy of language, concerning the meaning of words. Her\nperspective was exciting and novel, and very much in the naturalistic spirit\nof what I\u2019d been thinking. So, I wrote back to say that I thought her\n\u201cfundamental idea about the evolution of linguistic features is perfectly\nplausible and well worth pursuing.\u201d In 1981, a big box arrived in the mail\nfrom her. Uh-oh, I thought. What had I set in motion? It was her draft of\nLanguage, Thought, and Other Biological Categories.

I\nsuggested to Harry Stanton that Bradford Books should probably publish it,\nbut I thought he should get a couple of other referees whose views were at\nsome distance from mine to look it over, since I was perhaps too\nsympathetic to her iconoclastic spirit (having completed \u201cBeyond Belief\u201d\nbut not yet having gotten much significant feedback on that subversive\neffort).

{"paragraph": "\u2026 Beirut\nWhen I went off to graduate school in Oxford in 1963, Mother returned to\nher beloved Beirut to be the librarian at the American Community School\nattached to the American University of Beirut, and my younger sister,\nCharlotte, finished high school there. Susan and I joined them for a few\nweeks in the summer of 1964, along with my older sister, Cynthia, and\nenjoyed one of the happiest periods in Beirut\u2019s troubled history, when it was\nrightly called the Paris of the Middle East. Mother\u2019s apartment had a\nrooftop swimming pool, from which we could look down on the\nMediterranean and the seaside amusement park where a traveling circus\nwas summering and listen to lions roar and elephants trumpet while we\nsipped drinks on the balcony. We could also watch a dance group rehearsing\nthe dabke and other Levantine dances to be performed at the Baalbeck\nfestival later in the summer. Susan and Charlotte and I took a quick trip to\nDamascus, and then took a service (a fixed-route, scheduled taxi that takes\nmultiple passengers) to Jerusalem (Jordan, not Israel). There are four\npassenger seats in a service, and I attempted to purchase the fourth seat, so\nwe\u2019d have the car to ourselves with a little more comfort, but the driver was\nstrangely unwilling to consider this. The well-dressed man who insisted on\njoining us turned out to be Abu Nada, a Palestinian who had risen in the\nranks of the government of Jordan. He took an instant liking to this trio of\nyoung Americans and was delighted to teach me a lot of Arabic words on\nthe daylong journey, which included\u2014at his direction\u2014unscheduled stops\nat the ruins of Jerash and several other out-of-the-way points of interest. By\nthe time we approached Jerusalem, he had promised a swim in the Dead\nSea that evening and a mensef feast the next day with a Bedouin sheik who\nowed him a favor and was summering outside Jericho. At a mensef, with the\n\fguests seated on rugs around a huge copper tray piled with rice and lamb,\nthe guest of honor is offered the lamb\u2019s eye to eat.\n    On the drive out beyond Jericho, I asked Abu Nada which would be\nworse etiquette: firmly declining the offer of the sheep\u2019s eye or trying and\nfailing to gag the thing down? Neither would do, he replied, but we could\ntry a diplomatic end run; I could make a flowery speech of thanks to the\nsheik, which Abu would translate, in which I asked permission to convey\nthe honor of the lamb\u2019s eye to my dear friend Abu Nada, in gratitude for\nmaking this occasion possible. If the sheik accepted, Abu would happily eat\nthe eye, as he had done on many occasions; if not, I was to take a deep\nbreath and gulp the orb down one way or another. The sheik granted my\nrequest, so I have still never swallowed a lamb\u2019s eye. But I did witness the\nslaughtering of the lamb, at arm\u2019s length. A little lamb was brought out by\nthe sheik\u2019s formally dressed chief servant, and after I had duly praised it for\nits beauty (jamil ktir), he took out his long curved knife and slit its throat,\nletting the blood spurt out at our feet. Then he cut a small slit in one of the\nlamb\u2019s hind legs near the hoof, hung it on a tent pole, and at lightning speed\nskinned the animal down to its head and shoulders, creating a bag into\nwhich, with a single deft stroke, he emptied the entrails, cutting off the\nlamb\u2019s head and front legs with a mighty swipe of his blade and handing the\nbag to his assistant. He left the rest of the butchering to his underlings, who\ncarried off the clean carcass to be cut and prepared. Meanwhile Susan and\nmy sisters were in the women\u2019s tent, helping to make the flatbreads, which\nwere cooked on a metal dome over a wood fire. Then they got to try on the\nwedding dress and jewels of the sheik\u2019s latest wife, with cascades of gold\ncoins covering their faces like a veil. Quite a day, and the rest of our visit\nwas equally full of splendors.\n    Years passed, Mother died, Charlotte had an adventurous career as a\njournalist in Beirut, and I paid a brief visit there to give a talk at AUB,\nduring a trip to Istanbul. Would I like to spend a semester at AUB?\nAbsolutely. All my life, I had wanted to teach there, where my father had\ntaught and met my mother, and where I had gone to nursery school in the\n\u201940s. (I amused my parents\u2019 friends when they visited us and asked if I,\naged four or five, went to school. \u201cOh yes,\u201d I always replied. \u201cI go to\n\fAUB.\u201d) So in 2011 Susan and I returned to Beirut for a spring semester, and\npart of my preparation was to remind myself that it couldn\u2019t be as grand an\nadventure as my parents\u2019 years in the \u201930s and \u201940s, or even our own\nadventures in the \u201960s. But it would still be fun. In fact the young faculty in\nthe philosophy department and a few from other departments, mostly single\nand without children, adopted us immediately and took us on many\nadventures. We had a favorite taxi driver, who used to park within a block\nof our apartment in Ras Beirut just a few blocks from the university and\nseemed always to be ready on a minute\u2019s notice to take us wherever we\nwanted to go. (Sometimes he would warn us that where we wanted to go\nwas dangerous. The troubles in Syria prevented us from making a return\ntrip to Damascus, for instance, and the road to Baalbek was no longer safe.)\n    The students at AUB were intrepid and intellectually curious, and it was\na joy to see young men and women from all over the Arabic-speaking world\n(a few women heavily veiled but others in miniskirts) learning together,\nliving together, preparing to take their places in critical roles in their home\ncountries as generations have done since the founding of AUB in 1866 by\nan American educator and missionary, Daniel Bliss. It\u2019s a beautiful campus\noverlooking the Mediterranean, and even in the most terrible times during\nthe civil war of the 1980s, when one president of the university was\nkidnapped and another was murdered, it has kept going, and it continues to\ndo so, with Lebanon in desperate financial shape following the large\nexplosion and the continuing wars in the region, with refugee camps to\nmaintain, and intermittent failures of the national infrastructure.\n    I went back to AUB for a philosophy conference in 2018 and returned in\nJune of 2022 to accept an honorary doctorate and give the keynote speech.\nLebanon, Beirut, and AUB are all bravely recovering from their recent\ncatastrophes as they have always done in the past. Watching the hundreds of\nyoung doctors and engineers and economists\u2014and yes, even philosophers\n\u2014march proudly by me with their hard-won diplomas gives me hope for\nthe future.", "location": 692080}

{"paragraph": "O   NE DAY THAT FIRST YEAR AT   OXFORD, I ENGAGED IN a long discussion with\nsome other graduate students in philosophy about the strange experience of\nhaving one\u2019s arm \u201cfall asleep\u201d and go numb and uncontrollable for a few\nminutes, dangling helplessly from one\u2019s shoulder. What was that all about?\nWe compared notes; we\u2019d all had the experience, which was indeed\nremarkable, and I began wondering aloud what caused it\u2014did pressure on\nblood vessels starve the nerves, or was it direct pressure on nerves that shut\nthem down temporarily? The other students looked at me as if I\u2019d lost my\nmind. What did anatomy or neurophysiology have to do with this? This was\na philosophical puzzle that needed analysis, not anatomy lessons. I was\nastonished by this lack of interest in the physical phenomenon, and after the\nsession broke up I headed for the library to see what I could learn. That was\nthe start of my scientific education. I ended up spending more time in the\nRadcliffe Science Library than in the Bodleian and soon was following\nthreads from encyclopedias to books and thence to journal articles. I knew\nnothing about the nervous system, but if I was interested in the concept of\nmind, as I certainly was, I would have to learn about the brain.\n   Professor Ryle was tolerant of my conviction, though he himself knew\nnext to nothing about science, especially about neurophysiology and\n\fneuroanatomy (the term \u201cneuroscience\u201d hadn\u2019t come into favor yet). He\nsent me to a professor of neuroanatomy he knew and encouraged me to\ncheck out the experimental-psychology people, where I found Brian A.\nFarrell, then the Wilde Reader of Mental Philosophy, a wonderful title\nreserved for a philosopher who would be housed in the Department of\nExperimental Psychology but was explicitly forbidden to do experiments.\n(Those who created the chair knew what they were doing. The\npsychologists would love to have appointed a fellow psychologist to the\nposition and called him or her a philosopher, but that was effectively ruled\nout by the prohibition.) Brian took me in tow and taught me a lot of\npsychology, including an introduction to J. J. Gibson\u2019s work. He wrote one\nvery fine philosophy paper, \u201cExperience\u201d (1950), which was published in\nMind, the journal Ryle edited, and later anthologized in a collection of\npapers entitled simply The Philosophy of Mind, published in 1962 by\nPrentice Hall and a widely used textbook in philosophy-of-mind classes.\nFarrell\u2019s paper contained an explicit discussion of what it is like to be a bat\n\u2014a quarter century before Thomas Nagel published his famous paper. I\nonce pointed this out in a footnote, some years later, and Tom wrote me an\nembarrassed note telling me he had often been asked how he came to write\nhis paper and had told people about a vacation he had spent in a house on\nLong Island where bats thrived, which had occasioned his interest. But\nwhen he got out his copy of The Philosophy of Mind, he saw that he had\nunderlined Farrell\u2019s phrases and marked the bat passage with marginalia.\n    I have never put much emphasis on priority disputes in philosophy; we\nphilosophers all have access to the same literatures and the fads and trends\nthat arise in them, and it is often a matter of roughly simultaneously having\nthe same reaction to something striking in what has recently been\npublished. Doug Hofstadter and I once had a running disagreement about\nwho first came up with the quip \u201cAnything you can do I can do meta\u201d; I\ncredited him and he credited me. Well, it\u2019s a line to be remembered,\nsumming up neatly the way philosophers often work. In fact, I have taken\npleasure, not offense, at seeing many of my ideas (well, I think they were\nfirst my ideas) rediscovered, reinvented, by philosophers over the past half\ncentury without any acknowledgment. My writing style tends to go down so\n\fsmoothly that philosophers often don\u2019t realize what they are absorbing as\nthey dash through my books and articles. It doesn\u2019t matter; getting the ideas\nright is what matters.\n    Plagiarism, on the other hand, is, as everyone knows, the great academic\nsin. Over the years, I\u2019ve had a few students submit plagiarized term papers\nto me, and after the first few instances I have made a point of warning my\nstudents at the outset of a course that I think there is no excuse at all for\nplagiarism, and that if I ever catch a student plagiarizing I will not just give\nthem an F in the course but also do what I can to get them expelled. \u201cTake\nan F in the course; drop the course; beg me for an extension. Just don\u2019t\nplagiarize!\u201d That catches everyone\u2019s attention. I think the first plagiarized\npaper I received was by an Irvine student who was so na\u00efve she didn\u2019t\nrealize that no young woman in 1960s California would or could write\nusing the stately Victorian cadences of Benjamin Jowett, the famous Oxford\ntranslator of Plato. She had simply copied about half of his introduction to\none of Plato\u2019s dialogues and presented it as her own considered thought on\nthe topic. She got off with a reprimand and a warning. The most remarkable\ncase involved a woman in our MA program in philosophy at Tufts. She was\na fireball, hardly able to contain herself in class, full of ideas and\nobjections, reading beyond the syllabus. We thought she was wonderful.\nShe wanted to continue in the PhD program at MIT, and I wrote her a very\nenthusiastic letter of reference, supporting my point with a photocopy of\nseveral pages of a paper she had done for me on B. F. Skinner\u2019s various\nstands on behaviorism to show the MIT admissions committee her\nscholarship and the acuteness of her mind. A few days later, I got a\ntelephone call from Ned Block, then at MIT, telling me that he recognized\nthe work on Skinner; it had been drawn from a PhD dissertation at Harvard\non which he had been the outside examiner. I went down the road to\nWidener Library and found that he was right; she\u2019d copied from this\nunpublished dissertation word for word. I was chair of the philosophy\ndepartment at the time, and I called a meeting to discuss what we should do.\nShe had all As and even a few A+s from us, but now all her grades in our\ncourses were in question. Sleuthing in those days (before the internet) was a\nlaborious task, but perhaps we\u2019d all have to become detectives for a while. I\n\foffered a suggestion. I would call her into my office, give her a chance to\nconfess first, then confront her with the evidence I\u2019d photocopied from the\nHarvard dissertation and give her two choices: (1) She could hang tough, in\nwhich case we in the department would suspend all her grades, hunt for her\nsources, and drag her through the sort of trial that universities have for\ndealing with such cases (and we already had her dead to rights on one\ncount). Or (2) she could agree to withdraw from Tufts immediately for\nundisclosed \u201cpersonal reasons\u201d and sign a statement I had prepared for her\nthat would go into her file and permanently prohibit Tufts from revealing\nany information, any transcript of grades, even any acknowledgment that\nshe had ever been there.\n   I called her in and gave her an opportunity to confess. Not a word. So, I\nshowed her the evidence and presented the choices, and not surprisingly she\ntook option 2. It didn\u2019t end there. I told her I knew she was deeply, even\npassionately, interested in how the mind worked, and although she couldn\u2019t\nhelp her case now, I thought she might be willing to explore with me what it\nwas like when she was copying those pages. What thoughts went through\nher head, what reason could she have given herself to justify or explain her\nbehavior? How could such a smart woman do such a thing? I was genuinely\ncurious and would gladly have discussed this with her for hours, but she\nclammed up entirely, I\u2019m sad to say, so I never got to learn how she\nmanaged it. I thought we\u2019d handled it the right way, but less than a year\nlater I got an evening call at home from Israel (\u201cIzzy\u201d) Scheffler, a\nphilosopher at Harvard\u2019s Graduate School of Education, who told me he\nhad a problem. He had a student who had been at Tufts\u2014he thought,\nbecause she had once mentioned my name\u2014but when he inquired about her\nat Tufts, they denied all knowledge of her. \u201cAnd what is your problem?\u201d I\nasked, not admitting I knew anything about her. He told me he had caught\nher plagiarizing a term paper and wondered what I thought he should do\nabout it. \u201cWell, Izzy, this is just my advice, but here\u2019s what I think you\nshouldn\u2019t do. You shouldn\u2019t promise her to keep it a secret and let her go on\nher way.\u201d I don\u2019t know what Izzy did, and I\u2019ve never heard of her, or from\nher, again. I hope she\u2019s found a path to a rewarding\u2014and honest\u2014life.\n\f   I know how easy it is to commit negligent (not deliberate) plagiarism.\nSome years ago, I was invited by Robert Kane to write a piece for his\nanthology, The Oxford Handbook of Free Will. I readily accepted and\ndrafted a paper, and as I was rereading it before sending it to Kane I\nsuddenly had an unsettling thought. Weren\u2019t the main ideas in this paper the\nideas that my former student, the pianist Christopher Taylor, had developed\nin his term paper in my seminar a few years earlier? Fortunately I\u2019d saved a\ncopy of it, and sure enough, I\u2019d reinvented Kit Taylor\u2019s points in my own\nlanguage. I had been so close to doing something awful! I got in touch with\nKit and invited him to be principal author of a coauthored piece on free will\nfor the Kane anthology. By this time, he was giving concerts around the\nworld, but he liked the idea, and we worked many long hours together on\nour paper and later wrote a revision for the second edition. Kane\u2019s notes\nabout the contributors don\u2019t list Kit\u2019s philosophical publications\u2014this being\nhis first\u2014but do provide a discography!\n   So, I almost committed plagiarism myself. I have also committed what\nmay be the only case of reverse plagiarism. I published my second book on\nfree will, Freedom Evolves, in 2003, and afterward participated in a\nconference on it in which the philosopher Alfred Mele pointed out that I\nhad attributed to him something I called the Default Responsibility\nPrinciple: roughly, if you are causally involved in a misdeed and nobody\nelse is responsible (hypnosis, coercion, nefarious neurosurgery, \u2026), you\nare. Mele insisted he had never formulated any such principle, but my old\nnotes on his book even listed the page number, so I went back to my copy\nof it, and, sure enough, I had written in the margin \u201cDefault Responsibility\nPrinciple.\u201d It was my idea, but it was provoked (or inspired, if you like) by\nwhat he had written. Fortunately, I had thought well of the Default\nResponsibility Principle. If I had invented it, provoked by him, and then\ntrashed the idea, that would have been a different story! Another close call.\n   One of the first \u201coriginal\u201d ideas I had about the brain was one I\u2019ve\nalready mentioned: when I learned about neurons and neural networks, I\nenvisioned a process that, like natural selection, could mindlessly reshape\nthe brain to learn whatever was there to be learned. That became the\nbackbone of my dissertation, along with an account of consciousness that\n\fsharply distinguished the consciousness of human beings from that of\nanimals. Another key idea in my dissertation was inspired by a series of\npapers by Hilary Putnam, beginning with \u201cMinds and Machines\u201d (1960). I\nhad a friend in Oxford who heard Putnam (then at MIT) lecturing on the\ntopic and brought me a photocopy of another, newer paper by Putnam on\nrobots, which initially filled me with frustration, because I had spent\nmonths thinking about the 1960 paper and had arrived at roughly the\nposition Putnam\u2019s new paper maintained, but in it he went a bit further.\nThen there was a third Putnam paper, which again leapfrogged my own\nunderstanding. I can remember telling friends that I wished Putnam would\njust get distracted from this path and worry about some other issue for a\nwhile so I could catch up! Alas, my wish soon came true. The Vietnam War\nlured Putnam into a multiyear anti-war campaign during which he came\nclose to losing his mind. (Later, after we were friends and colleagues, he\ntold me he considered this a psychotic break in his life, which I think is the\nright way to put it. More on Hilary to come.)\n   Another main source of inspiration was the physicist (and philosopher!)\nDonald M. MacKay, one of the brilliant thinkers in Great Britain whose\nearly work on \u201ccybernetics\u201d gave birth to computer science. He was a\nmember of the Ratio Club, an informal self-organized group that met over\ndinner to discuss cybernetic issues and included Alan Turing, W. Ross\nAshby, W. Grey Walter, Horace Barlow, I. J. Good, and some half a dozen\nothers. MacKay\u2019s little book of essays, Information, Mechanism and\nMeaning (1970), is a gold mine of wise observations on the three topics in\nhis title, and he also wrote a paper on free will that no philosopher should\nignore. He is also the originator of the oft-quoted but mis-cited definition of\ninformation as a difference that makes a difference and is one of the first\nscientists I encountered who took a positive and productive attitude toward\nphilosophy. I didn\u2019t meet him when I was at Oxford, but we briefly\ncorresponded, and when I finished my DPhil dissertation I mailed a copy,\nunsolicited, to him. He wrote me back a thoughtful and valuable letter, and\nwe later met on several of his visits to the US, including once when I\ninvited him to give a talk at Tufts. One topic we discussed, constructively,\nwas his devout Christianity, which of course I didn\u2019t share. He never came\n\fclose to persuading me to consider joining a church, but he gave me an\nexcellent model of a brilliant scientist whose mind was not in any way\ndisabled by faith\u2014there aren\u2019t many, in my experience (see chapter 27). I\nalso learned something about how to think about information in the brain\u2014\nstill a major puzzle in cognitive science\u2014from a book published by the\nyoung mathematician and neuroscientist Michael Arbib called Brains,\nMachines, and Mathematics (1964) and one of the first anthologies of early\nwork on artificial intelligence, Minds and Machines (1964), edited by the\nPittsburgh logician Alan Ross Anderson.\n    According to legend, and perhaps it is true, the Voltaire Society at\nOxford was founded by an undergraduate who said, falsely, in a London job\ninterview that he had founded a philosophical discussion group, the Voltaire\nSociety, and its patron was Bertrand Russell. When the student got back to\nOxford he immediately founded the society and invited Bertrand Russell to\nbe the patron, and Russell accepted. Each term there was a new president,\nwhose duties were to invite three speakers for the next term, with\ncommentators, and to write Russell a letter about the society\u2019s activities.\nRussell typically replied. When it became my turn to be president, one of\nthe speakers I invited was Alan Anderson, who was that year a visiting\nprofessor at the University of Manchester. I asked him to speak about\nartificial intelligence (instead of relevance logic, his specialty) and he was\nhappy to oblige.\n    I won\u2019t try to recall all the other articles and books on AI and the brain\nthat I read while researching for my dissertation, but of course I also was\nscouring the philosophy journals for relevant articles. Almost no\nphilosophers were writing anything about scientific research on the mind,\nbut the principal Australian philosophers of mind, J. J. C. Smart and David\nArmstrong, were writing excellent essays and books proposing and\ndefending materialism and the so-called identity theory of mind, the simple\nclaim that the mind and the brain were identical and that mental events of\nall kinds (if you thought about it just right) were things that happened in the\nbrain. This led to scores of articles by philosophers mostly concentrating on\ndelicate issues of how to frame the proposed identities. Was it mental\nimages or experiences-of-having-mental-images that were identical with\n\fbrain processes (or should we say \u201cbrain states\u201d or \u201cneural events\u201d or \u2026)?\nThe linguist James McAuley once joked about how to tell philosophers\nfrom linguists; he said that the philosopher is the one who reads a paper on\nthe hangman paradox at the conference on capital punishment. And a\nphilosopher\u2014was it Kierkegaard?\u2014once said that when philosophers are\nshown an arrow they concentrate on the arrow instead of on what the arrow\npoints to. It was obligatory that I confront the Australians\u2019 identity theory in\nmy dissertation, and I wrote a very Quinian, but also rather Rylean, chapter\non it\u2014to get it out of the way, or so I thought.\n   With regard to those two influences: When I arrived in Oxford, I thought\nof myself as the Arch Anti-Quinian but was immediately and correctly\nidentified by other graduate students and the philosophy dons as the Village\nQuinian. I accepted much more of his perspective than any of them did. I\nalso thought that Ryle was having no major influence on me, though he was\na wonderful lifter of spirits when I went to see him, often with thoughts on\nmy mind about resigning due to the difficulties I was encountering. When I\ncompared my finished dissertation to an early draft that I hadn\u2019t thrown\naway, however, I discovered that Ryle\u2019s influence was all through it,\nsomething that made me ashamed that I had been telling anybody who\nasked that Ryle had been a good cheerleader but I\u2019d learned nothing from\nhim. He understood the power of using lots of examples and analogies to\nunsettle readers\u2019 lazy imaginations, and he had a keen nose for unexamined\npresuppositions. To give just one example of a Ryle-inspired move of my\nown, consider what a voice is. Is it a physical organ that can be strained, a\nsound that can be recorded and recognized, an event, a process? Are voices\nto be identified with larynxes?", "location": 145888}

My\nmathematician friends at UC Irvine had told me of the spring torrent of\ncitizen phone calls asking how to calculate percentages for their income tax\nreturns. A biologist told me of being haunted by a call from a somewhat\ninebriated citizen late one evening in his lab, which went as follows:\n    \u201cYou a biologist?\u201d\n    \u201cYes.\u201d\n    \u201cI have a bet on with my buddy here, and maybe you can settle it.\u201d\n    \u201cMaybe.

I had a few calls from people who\nwanted to talk about the meaning of life, but the only one I stayed with for\nmore than a polite minute or so was from a young man who was on duty all\n\falone in a fire tower on a mountaintop, scanning for wisps of smoke, signs\nof forest fires. He\u2019d been thinking, he said, and couldn\u2019t see a good reason\nfor not jumping off the tower. We talked for maybe an hour, until we both\ndecided that perhaps I\u2019d given him some pretty good reasons for seeing\nwhat the next day, the next month, the next year would bring. I have no idea\nwhether I saved a life that day.\n   A more troubling case occurred a few years later, when I\u2019d moved from\nIrvine to Tufts. I had a brilliant young undergraduate student we\u2019ll call\nCarolyn, who came to my office hour one day and challenged me: Why\nshouldn\u2019t she kill herself? Knowing her intense and unusually mature\ninterest in philosophy, I hit upon a scheme. A year or two before, Tom\nNagel had given a fascinating talk, \u201cThe Absurd,\u201d at the American\nPhilosophical Association annual meeting, in which he addressed in sober\nand analytical terms the possible, even probable, meaninglessness of life.\nHe had asked Rogers Albritton, his advisor at Harvard, to give the\ncommentary, and Albritton, who had also been my advisor, accepted the\ninvitation, and spoke eloquently to an auditorium packed with philosophers.\nNagel\u2019s talk had ended with a rather bleak conclusion:", "location": 418618}
{"paragraph": "W    HEN  MIKHAIL GORBACHEV WAS LEADER OF THE USSR and introduced his\nrevolutionary policy of glasnost, or openness, in 1985, his wife Raisa, a\nphilosopher, supported an invitation from Russian philosophers to the\nAmerican Philosophical Association to bring a delegation of American\nphilosophers to Moscow and Leningrad for a week of conferences to get to\nknow each other. Eight of us were chosen\u2014William Alston of Syracuse,\nKeith Lehrer and Alvin Goldman of the University of Arizona, Sydney\nShoemaker of Cornell, H\u00e9ctor-Neri Casta\u00f1eda of Indiana, Jaakko Hintikka\nof Boston University, Jaegwon Kim of Michigan, and myself\u2014and we\narrived in Moscow on Black Monday, October 19, 1987, the day of the\nprecipitous crash on Wall Street. I remember the date well, because our\nRussian hosts were curious to see if we capitalist philosophers would be\njumping out of windows or weeping into our tea, having lost our fortunes,\nbut none of us was much affected by the plunge.\n   No one in our group understood more than a word or two of Russian, but\nthe few Russians who spoke good English provided impromptu paragraph-\nby-paragraph translation of the talks and discussions. My talk on\nintentionality was deliberately introductory and noncontroversial, I thought,\nbut my translator thought otherwise. I would speak a few bland sentences,\nand then he would burst into impassioned Russian, pounding his fist in his\nhand, jumping around, gesticulating and frowning and using more than\n\ftwice as much time as I had used in provoking him with my sentences. I\nwas baffled, and so were my American colleagues. It occurred to me later\nthat this would make a hilarious skit for Monty Python or Saturday Night\nLive, but that skit still lies in the future. To this day I have no idea what he\nthought was so radical or outrageous in my talk.\n   Our time in Moscow was eye-opening, with visits to Red Square and a\nride on the Metro, which the Soviets had built in grand style, celebrating the\nproletariat with heroic murals, mosaics, statuary, and stunning chandeliers.\nOur hosts gave us each an envelope stuffed with walking-around money,\nrubles we could use as we chose, but we had hardly any opportunities to\nspend them, since our meals were almost all provided and the Beryozka\nshops, where the best tourist mementos were to be found, didn\u2019t accept\nrubles. (I bought a small metal bust of Lenin in GUM, the famous\ndepartment store, and it rested on my desk at Tufts for years.)\n   I had been told by a friend who had often been to Moscow that I should\ntry to have dinner one night in the restaurant on the top floor of the Rossiya\nHotel in Red Square, where the food and the views of the Kremlin were\nspectacular. On our one free night on our own, I led a delegation of a half\ndozen of us to the Rossiya, the largest hotel in Europe and maybe in the\nworld, assuring them that it was something special. We looked around in the\nlobby for any signs for the restaurant. No signs. We asked at the desk; they\ndidn\u2019t understand English, it seemed. So, we started getting in elevators and\npushing the top button. We tried all the elevators in sight and arrived each\ntime at nondescript corridors of hotel rooms. The gang was getting hungry\nand dubious, and I pleaded with them to give me one more chance. We\nwalked through some unpromising doors on the ground floor into empty\ncorridors but eventually found another elevator. We all jumped in, and when\nthe doors opened on the top floor, we were greeted by a ma\u00eetre d\u2019 in tails\nand ushered into the fabulous restaurant, which was hardly occupied. We\ncommandeered a large table in front of the central picture window and\nlooked out on the sparkling scene. You\u2019ve probably seen the view on\ntelevision. This was where they put the TV cameras whenever they showed\nparades and the like on the US evening news. (The Rossiya was demolished\nin 2006, so that view is gone for good.) We ordered up everything exotic on\n\fthe menu, washed down the caviar and fish with bottles of vodka, and when\nthe considerable bill arrived, we pooled all our rubles and paid\u2014to the deep\ndissatisfaction of the ma\u00eetre d\u2019, who wanted dollars, of course.\n   We traveled by train to Leningrad, which was in terrible shape, with\npower and phone lines strung haphazardly from building to building,\npeeling paint, broken cornices, and roads sometimes impassable because of\nunfinished repairs. Still, the beauty of the city was apparent: the Hermitage\nmuseum, the rows of decaying urban palaces, the canals, the squares and\nparks.\n   The philosophy at Leningrad State University was unimpressive, in part\nbecause there were several distinct philosophy departments: the Department\nof Dialectical Materialism, the Department of Marxist/Leninist Philosophy\nof Science, the Department of the History of Russian Philosophy, and others\nsimilarly restrictive in outlook. But the city was fascinating. The beautiful\ncity that Peter the Great founded in 1703 houses his personal museum\u2014one\nof my favorite museums, because it is, among other things, a museum of\nmuseums. This is what museums were like in the early eighteenth century,\nwith huge glass cases filled with curiosities and crafts from around the\nworld, identified on tiny cards propped up beside them, and the fetus of a\ntwo-headed calf preserved in alcohol in a large glass jar sitting in the same\ncase as an Inuit tool kit. Peter\u2019s extensive collection of kayaks and other\nboats, harpoons, and sealskin clothes reminds us that Russia owned Alaska\nuntil 1867. I hope they haven\u2019t \u201cmodernized\u201d the museum since!\n   A few years later, Susan and I were in Finland, and I urged her to join\nme for a visit to Leningrad, as it was still called, where we stayed overnight\nin a dreadful Intourist hotel, with a grim woman on a chair watching the\ncorridor all night long (and handing out portions of toilet paper to guests\nwhen needed) while we tried to sleep in our unlockable room. (The door\nhad been jimmied open several times in the past, and the hotel hadn\u2019t\nbothered fixing the scars or twisted metal, an effective reminder that we\nwere behind the Iron Curtain.) The shoddy workmanship was striking. I\nnoticed that the corners of the wooden frame around the elevator door\nopening were sawn to maybe forty-seven and forty-six degrees instead of\nforty-five degrees, creating ugly gaps in the frame. That had to be\n\fdeliberate, I figured, and I was reminded of the slogan going around then in\nRussia: \u201cWe pretend to work, and they pretend to pay us.\u201d But Leningrad\nwas still beautiful, and I remarked at the time that if only a few hundred\nAmerican corporations decided that they needed bases in Russia, they could\nrestore the city to its czarist glory. That\u2019s pretty much what has happened.\n    In 2001, a large cardboard box addressed to me in beautiful calligraphic\nhandwriting arrived with no return address in my office at Tufts. Since the\nUnabomber\u2019s dangerous exploits were still on people\u2019s minds, I called the\ncampus police and let them handle it. (Three officers arrived and the most\njunior was invited to open it, which he obediently did, unscathed.) Inside\nwas a varnished mahogany case with a gilt medallion, and inside that, on a\nsilken pillow, was a faux-Faberg\u00e9 egg and a handwritten invitation to Susan\nand me to join Paul Allen (the cofounder of Microsoft) on a long weekend\ncruise from Helsinki to St. Petersburg. \u201cBut we\u2019ve been to St. Petersburg!\u201d\nSusan said, and I replied, \u201cNot like this, we haven\u2019t.\u201d This was going to be\nSt. Petersburg as the czars would want you to see it. We accepted the\ninvitation.\n    Paul Allen\u2019s cruises were spectacular. He was a talented rock-and-roll\nguitarist, and he wanted to play with good musicians to an audience of\npeople who could dance or listen, but of course he didn\u2019t want to hire an\naudience, so he came up with a great idea: throw an irresistible party for the\npeople whose minds and deeds he admired and, after each day of tourism,\nhave a jam session that lasted almost all night. He had hosted earlier cruises\nalong the Alaska coast and in the Mediterranean. This time, he flew his\nguests by chartered 747 from Seattle, Newark, or London to Helsinki,\nwhere we had a day in Finland to shed jet lag before boarding a small cruise\nship he had chartered. We motored through the night, arriving in St.\nPetersburg\u2019s harbor at dawn and sailing up the Neva River to the first\nbridge, in sight of the Hermitage. Susan and I were among about 250 other\nguests, composed of basically three groups: people whose work in rock \u2019n\u2019\nroll, science, or the arts had impressed him; old friends of his from high\nschool days in Seattle; and friends of his mother, who was a retired\nlibrarian. So, on the one hand there were movie stars (Robin Williams, Meg\nRyan, Susan Sarandon, Laurence Fishburne, Dan Aykroyd, Carrie Fisher,\n\fJeff Goldblum), authors (Ivan Doig, Tom Stoppard, David Halberstam), and\nscientists (James Watson; Bill Calvin and his wife, Katherine Graubard),\nalong with dozens of well-read and charming retired librarians. Why was I\ninvited? Because Paul Allen had funded the excellent PBS television series\non evolution, the first program of which was called \u201cDarwin\u2019s Dangerous\nIdea\u201d and featured me briefly in an interview.\n    After the opening banquet on the ship, Susan was dead tired and went to\nbed early, but I went prowling around the ship and ended up in the library,\nwhere I taught the game of Frigate Bird (lightning anagrams with Scrabble\ntiles and no board) to Tom Stoppard and Martha Stewart, kibitzed by Robin\nWilliams and Jeff Goldblum; Martha Stewart played with intensity and does\nnot like to lose! I went on a helicopter tour of some of the czar\u2019s palaces\nand had neglected to bring along a box lunch, but Martha, seated next to\nme, had made some extra sandwiches, which she shared with me. Susan and\nI helped Laurence Fishburne pick out a fancy painted cane for his mother in\na souvenir shop. A private tour of the Hermitage, an evening of the Moscow\nCircus in town, a concert in a palace, and a closing banquet at the Catherine\nPalace with the Bolshoi Ballet and endless silver trays of caviar, a balalaika\norchestra, and then a rock-and-roll concert in a tent with the Black Crowes\n\u2014even the Hollywood celebrities were gobsmacked. It was amusing to\nwatch them taking iPhone photos with all the enthusiasm of us regular\nfolks.\n    I had noticed during the initial lifeboat drill that Jim Watson and his wife\nwere among the guests, and when I saw Jeff Goldblum in the library I\ncomplimented him on his portrayal of Watson in the BBC docudrama, Life\nStory: The Race for the Double Helix, and asked if he had met Watson.\nNever. So I had the fun of introducing the two of them. Jeff, more than a\nfoot taller than Jim, had played him as a gawky, horny, super-American\nnerd, and he deferentially asked him if anything in his portrayal had\nbothered him. \u201cYes,\u201d Jim replied immediately. \u201cYou chewed gum. I would\nnever chew gum!\u201d It had been my good fortune to be invited with Pat and\nPaul Churchland to a showing of Life Story at the Cricks\u2019 house in La Jolla\nwhen it first came out, and Francis had often stopped the video that evening\nto interject a comment. After one of Goldblum\u2019s horny scenes, Francis had\n\fpaused the show to tell his guests that while he and Jim were dressing for\nthe 1962 Nobel ceremony, Jim had said to him, \u201cDo you know what I think\nis going to be great about having a Nobel Prize?\u201d \u201cNo, what?\u201d Francis\nreplied, expecting some exalted answer about advancing science. \u201cGetting\ndates,\u201d Jim said.", "location": 649760}

{"paragraph": "Cog\nBefore turning to the engineering of industrial robots, Rod Brooks had\ntaken a daring stab in 1993, leaping from insectoid control systems to a\ncomputational architecture for a humanoid robot named Cog. He invited me\n\fto join the team at the AI lab, on the top floors of the Tech Square building\nin Cambridge. Rod subscribed to the central idea of Consciousness\nExplained, which is that there is no \u201cCartesian Theater\u201d wherein the results\nof all our mental processing are somehow presented to an Inner Witness in\na special show. What is there instead are \u201cmultiple drafts\u201d of content, which\nvie for influence, with some achieving something like \u201cfame in the brain\u201d\nand the rest evaporating unheralded and unrecorded. (It is amazing to me\nhow seductive the idea of a Cartesian Theater still is, in spite of decades of\npatient diagnoses by me and others of the errors involved in thinking of\nconsciousness as a sort of movie, with a soundtrack, odors, itches, pains,\nand caresses piped in for the homunculus who gets to appreciate it all\nsomehow.) Rod was one thinker who got the point immediately, and he had\nno difficulty attracting me to join the Cog team, claiming that he and his\ngrad students wanted to implement the Multiple Drafts model of\nconsciousness in their robot. What a delicious invitation! How would I like\nto help some of the smartest young computer scientists in the world come\nup with an implementation of my ideas? The problems confronting Rod\u2019s\ngroup in the early going were a long way from the Multiple Drafts model,\nbut they were fascinating and important in their own ways.\n    Before Cog, robots moved \u201crobotically,\u201d in a jerky \u201cmechanical\u201d way,\nbut Cog, thanks to the \u201cseries elastic actuators\u201d in its arms and the swift\nresponses it made with its eyes and head when something of interest\nshowed up, was uncannily human in its reactions to simple things.\nPhilosophers had been posing arguments for decades about what could and\nshould persuade you to think of robots as conscious if you ever got close to\none, but I don\u2019t think any of them recognized that the more pressing and\nimmediate problem would be convincing folks that this robot, Cog, was not\nconscious. As you walked into the room where Cog lived (it was stationary,\nwith no legs, just a torso, arms, and a head), Cog would catch sight of you,\nand its eyes would follow you as you walked by. When Alan Alda was\nmaking a Scientific American documentary about Cog, he started asking\nRod a question while they were standing with Cog between them, and Cog\nturned and looked at Alan so briskly and \u201cintelligently\u201d that he was left\nspeechless. Another time, I took one of my Tufts teaching assistants to the\n\fCog lab so she could see what was going on. One of Cog\u2019s arms had been\ndetached from its torso and was clamped to a workbench while Matthew\nWilliamson, its designer, was working on it. The arm was ON, and Matt\ninvited her to shake hands with it. She did\u2014and screamed \u201cIt\u2019s alive!\u201d\nbecause the hand that grasped hers was compliant, gentle but strong, just\nlike the hand of a living person. Very quickly, the Cog project had a\nproblem with MIT students intent on demonstrating on behalf of Cog\u2019s\nrights. Here is one substantive message to extract from this tale: Don\u2019t trust\nyour \u201cintuitions\u201d! Our convictions about what is alive and what isn\u2019t, what\nis conscious and what isn\u2019t, are easily provoked and manipulated. Think of\nit this way: If oysters had a smiley-face pattern when you opened them, and\nseemed to have two eyespots with long, blinking eyelashes, few people\nwould be willing to eat them. In fact, if apples had chubby childish faces,\ncomplete with dimples, they would disconcert even the vegans.\n    I once attended an international workshop on \u201ccognitive robotics\u201d hosted\nby British Telecom. I was representing the Cog team, because Rod was\notherwise committed. The enticement was millions of pounds of research\nmoney to go to those with the best ideas. Why on earth did British Telecom\nwant to spend lots of money on robotics? It turned out that they had several\nquite independent reasons. First, they had come to realize that their vast\nnetworks of communication and control, built and rebuilt over many years,\nwith many insufficiently recorded fixes and adjustments, were simply not\ncomprehensible by anybody. (This is not an unusual feature of huge\ncomputer systems. Joe Weizenbaum scared the dickens out of me back in\n1973 by telling me that the software controlling the DEW line\u2014the\nDefense Early Warning radar system arrayed across northern Canada\u2014was\nutterly incomprehensible to its operators. I told him I was not a big fan of\nmilitary spending but I guessed I would support the cost of building a new\nsystem alongside the old and then discarding the old system. He replied that\nmany had thought of doing that, but nobody knew what the specs of the\nsystem were, so it would be impossible to be sure that they were met. The\nDEW system was ultimately abandoned.) British Telecom had the off-the-\nwall idea that if the roboticists could build a humanoid robot that could\ncommunicate comprehensively with human beings, virtual (software-only)\n\fversions of it could be set loose to prowl the BT network, identifying\nproblems and explaining them to human operators. (Shades of the great\nBritish sci-fi satire Max Headroom, in which a human being becomes\ndisembodied and lives on the internet, solving crimes.) Their other concern\nwas lead. It turns out that hundreds or maybe thousands of miles of\nunderground conduit had been installed by British Telecom over the years,\nand somebody had had the bright idea that shielding the wires in them with\nlead would protect them. Over the years, the lead had sagged onto the\nwires, preventing them from being pulled through the conduits and replaced\nwhen needed. Could the roboticists design a sort of mole robot that could\nprowl through the conduits, chomping its way carefully through the lead\nwithout cutting any wires, or at least guiding human repair people to the\npoints needing special attention? It became clear that even with the prospect\nof millions of pounds of support dangling in front of them, nobody could\nsay with a straight face that they could build the Max Headroom robot that\ncould save British Telecom from its puzzlement. And while a lead-\nchomping mole was not out of the question\u2014in a uniform and restricted\nartificial environment, with manufactured surfaces, and right angles almost\neverywhere\u2014nobody, so far as I know, seriously took up the challenge.\nHere was a case where hype and science fiction had come back to haunt the\nroboticists. I learned a lot there from the evolutionary robotics group at\nSussex, represented by Inman Harvey and Dave Cliff, but otherwise it was a\nlesson in misplaced hopes.\n\f                                     Cog\n                              PHOTO BY SAM OGDEN", "location": 577321}

{"paragraph": "The first step the engineers would take to build a truly autonomous drone\nwith onboard, not remote, control would be to throw away the LED screen\nwith all the colors, since those were designed for an agent with eyes and\ncolor vision. There is no movie in your head; there are only the myriad\ndiscernments of content you rely on to control your expectations and\nactions. And then what about free will? It is an achievement, not a\nmetaphysical feature, of normal human beings who have learned how to\ncontrol their many degrees of freedom\u2014and to keep others from remotely\ncontrolling them\u2014by developing such habits of self-stimulation as\nimagining and reflecting on the outcomes of possible actions. Initiation into\nadulthood (securing the right to make legally binding promises and move\nfreely around in the world) is itself a wonderful social mechanism and it too\nwas designed by natural selection of memes, refined over thousands of\nyears of civilization. All the glories of life depend on design, and designs\ncan be destroyed or damaged; a brain tumor can destroy your free will,\nother brain pathologies can render you unconscious or unable to discern the\nmeaning of the words you hear or say or read or write.\n   It takes vigilant thinking to avoid falling into the trap of imagining a\nCentral Meaner that is the source of meaning, a Self that is the evaluator\nand enjoyer of consciousness, a Soul that defies physics and makes your\ndecisions. These ideas are familiar and all but irresistible, and many\n\fthinkers find the prospect of abandoning them utterly repugnant. If you balk\nat relinquishing any of them, you are in good company, but just remind\nyourself that such ideas are all part of the largely benign user illusion that\nhas been cobbled together over the eons by the various kinds of natural\nselection.\n    Life is what brings reasons and meaning into existence, and in our neck\nof the universe only human beings have the thinking tools\u2014based on\nlanguage\u2014to figure this out. We are the only reasoners\u2014in the strong\nsense of explainers\u2014on the planet. Reasons predated reasoners by billions\nof years in the same way numbers predated mathematicians. It took two\nhydrogen atoms to unite with one oxygen atom to make a water molecule\nlong before anybody could count, and the reason that living things have\nmembranes isolating them (under controlled conditions) from the rest of the\nworld is that living things need to protect themselves from succumbing to\nthe second law of thermodynamics and can\u2019t afford to protect the whole\nworld, a reason that wasn\u2019t appreciated until very, very recently in the\nhistory of life on this planet. Every living thing is composed of parts that\nare the way they are for reasons, but only we human beings represent\nreasons. Evolution has gifted us, and all living things, with brilliantly\ndesigned mechanisms that make life easier than it otherwise would be, but\nthis gives living things competence without comprehension. Trees cope\nbrilliantly under many conditions without a shred of comprehension; so do\nrabbits and foxes and elephants, who do many wise things without needing\nto know why these are wise things to do or when to do them. It is our\nhuman capacity to frame why-questions and evaluate candidate answers\nthat sets us apart from the rest of nature, not some apparently magical soul\nthat does the understanding and the feeling, the loving and fearing.\n    Isn\u2019t this terribly anthropocentric? No, it is properly centered on what\nmatters. Control is the key to life and everything that matters. The more\nthings you can control, the more things can matter to you. Chimpanzees and\ndolphins are at risk from, but oblivious to, the problems of climate change,\neconomic inequality, pollution, and war, but we alone can think that these\nproblems matter enough to devote our energy to solving them. Noblesse\noblige. Descartes was right to insist that human beings are profoundly\n\fdifferent from other animals; he just made the mistake of trying to isolate\nthat difference in an immaterial and unfathomable lump of mind-stuff.\nReverse engineering that fantastic array of competences is the great\nintellectual adventure we are now embarked on, and it has been my\nextraordinary good fortune to be in the thick of it for my whole adult life.\n   We seem to be getting closer and closer to a stable solution to a lot of the\nproblems I\u2019ve been working on for more than half a century. First,\nmaterialism reigns, and the major philosophical problems of consciousness,\nmeaning, and free will all have accounts that owe more to biology than to\nphysics. The beginning of life is the beginning of reasons and meaning and\ninformation (in one of its most important senses); human brains have been\nturned into minds by the products of cultural evolution, of memes, not\ngenes; and consciousness creates the user illusion of a Self or Central\nMeaner, which is not a part of the brain (and certainly not an immaterial\nsoul playing the brain\u2019s keyboard, as Sir John Eccles would have it!) but\nbetter seen as a useful abstraction: the Center of Narrative Gravity. We ask\none another questions\u2014which the members of no other species can do\u2014\nand the answers we give are not infallible or perfectly available in\nintrospection, but as close as anyone can get to what we \u201creally mean.\u201d\nQuine is right to insist that radical translation is not guaranteed to find a\nsingle correct interpretation, and Millikan is right to insist that we don\u2019t\nhave privileged access to what or even whether we mean, and Haig is right\n\u2014along with Derrida\u2014to insist that there are only interpretations and\nfurther interpretations of interpretations and no good reason to call any of\nthem Absolute Truth. So we will have to settle, with science, on a\n\u201cvegetarian\u201d concept of truth, which is good enough to reveal the real\npatterns that have guided us to the moon and back and will soon take us to\nthe planets.", "location": 792978}
{"paragraph": "AFTER OUR FIRST MEETING in London (see chapter 16), Nick and I had\nseveral long discussions at conferences, and it was immediately clear that\nwe were going to be close friends for the rest of our lives, in spite of\u2014or\nperhaps because of\u2014our slowly emerging differences of opinion about\nconsciousness. Luckily, an early project Nick and I cooked up after he\njoined me at Tufts never got going: a documentary on what science has to\nsay about consciousness. We got tentative approval from the Annenberg\nFoundation to make a short series of programs, but the funding was pitiful,\nand rather than do a half-baked series of low-budget lectures with a few\ndiagrams, we dropped it\u2014a good thing, since our disagreements about key\naspects of consciousness were crystallizing and not getting resolved. I\nshudder to think of the impasses and arguments that would have erupted\nhad we been under time pressure to produce a television series.\n   Fortunately, another project emerged from our discussions: an\ninvestigation of multiple personality disorder (MPD). The publication of\nSybil by Flora Rheta Schreiber in 1973, boosted by the film (1976) starring\nSally Field, had triggered a diagnostic fad, with hundreds of supposed\n\u201cmultiples\u201d undergoing therapy and thousands more extrapolated by the\nenthusiasts. The cause of their condition was almost invariably described as\nhorrific sexual abuse during childhood. There were passionate defenders of\n\fthe diagnosis and equally passionate debunkers, and we decided to get to\nthe bottom of it if we could. The defenders were not all fringe folk; there\nwere professors of psychiatry at major medical schools who were\nconvinced this was a real phenomenon, not\u2014as the skeptics insisted\u2014a\nfolie \u00e0 deux (or trois or more!) The condition had been officially recognized\nin the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III,\n1980) of the American Psychiatric Association, but was more recently\nrenamed and redescribed as dissociative identity disorder (DID) in DSM-IV\nin 1994.\n    Nick and I both recognized that a self or ego was not an organ, nor was it\nan immaterial soul, as tradition would proclaim, but rather an abstraction, a\nvirtual machine, that emerged from the organization of forces and processes\nin the brain. As I had put it, the self was the center of narrative gravity.\nPerhaps we could learn more about normal solitary selves by studying\nabnormal multiple selves. We were eager to meet and interact with\nmultiples, of course, but the issues of medical confidentiality were tricky;\nfor instance, did all the \u201calters\u201d (the other personalities sharing the body\nwith the \u201chost\u201d) have to sign the consent form? With the careful\ncollaboration of some colleagues in the psychiatric community, we got to\nmeet a few multiples, though always in the presence of their therapists. A\nhypnotherapist showed us a videotape he had made of a session he had\nrecorded with a pitiful, mewling, crouching, shuddering young woman who\nsuddenly sat bolt upright and said in a loud, deep, menacing voice, \u201cI can\nkill her anytime I want!\u201d The therapist in the video leaped back in shock,\nmuch as we did watching the video (shades of The Exorcist!). We met with\ntherapists and family members, who gave us detailed descriptions of the\nafflicted individuals, but we could never quite dispel the atmosphere of awe\nthat, history tells us, permeated the s\u00e9ances conducted by supposed\npsychics that have had their own brief spotlights of fame over the past few\nhundred years. How do you explore your doubts regarding the wilder tales\nof satanic rituals and the like without insulting your informants and driving\nthem away? I found a handy application of a tactic I\u2019d sometimes used in\nmy youth when gently challenging adolescent tall tales of sexual exploits:\ndon\u2019t express skepticism; instead go all in hungrily for the details that tend\n\fto be neglected in fantasies. \u201cThese satanic rituals are amazing, but when\ndid you rehearse? Who assigned the roles? Did you make your own\ncostumes? Where did you hide them? Who cleaned up the mess?\u201d It\u2019s not\nall that hard to tell when somebody is inventing answers on the fly to\nquestions that had never occurred to them.\n    We attended the Fifth Annual Conference on Multiple\nPersonality/Dissociative States in Chicago, an eye-opening event where the\ndynamics of cultish amplification were very much in evidence. I\nparticipated in a breakout session in which a professor of psychiatry from a\nmajor university medical school told a small rapt audience about a young\ninternational tennis star he was treating. Her parents, who were also her\ncoaches, had arranged for her to become pregnant and give birth to a baby\ndestined for ritual sacrifice by the satanic cult to which her family\nbelonged! She was now back on the international tournament circuit but\nsuffering from MPD, which he was treating. How do you check up on a tale\nlike that without violating anybody\u2019s right to medical confidentiality? I\nfound a way: I called up Bud Collins, dean of tennis journalists, and,\nwithout giving him any details about the source of my curiosity, asked him\nif it would be possible for a young woman to complete a pregnancy and\nthen return to a relatively high ranking without anybody suspecting. Not a\nchance, he replied. The world of top tennis players, male and female, is too\ntightly interconnected, too curious and knowledgeable about the health and\nfitness of the players, and the journalists are too intrusive, for such a thing\nto happen. A disappearance from the scene for the better part of a year\nwould be a matter of intense curiosity. So the good professor must have\nbeen making it all up, or at least hugely embroidering a real case for\ndramatic effect. Nick and I saw a lot of that\u2014and we even discovered the\ntemptation in ourselves. Driving back from one interrogation or another, we\nwould find, when comparing notes on what we had observed, that we were\nstrongly tempted to exaggerate. Why? Because we both had a powerful\nsense that we had witnessed something upsetting and uncanny, something to\nwhich we had to give a dramatic boost in order to do justice to what we had\nexperienced. And perhaps we were also driven by the lurking suspicion that\nwe\u2019d been made complicit by the manipulative person we had tried to\n\finterview. If you want cooperation, you have to support the presentation;\nask too many tough questions and the alters just \u201cleave.\u201d\n   Once we were immersed in the material, I realized that our analysis of\nwhat we found would be of interest to a wider audience of educated\nthinkers, not just philosophers and psychologists, so I called up Barbara\nEpstein, editor of the New York Review of Books, to see if they might be\ninterested in the piece we were writing. Yes indeed, she said, so we tailored\nour piece to that audience. When we sent her the draft, we got a confusing\nset of editorial suggestions, and when we followed up with questions, we\ngot what seemed like a series of smoke screens, not critiques. Eventually,\nafter several further failed attempts at clarification about the criticisms she\noffered, Nick and I made an appointment to talk with her in her office in\nNew York. It did not go well. She was visibly upset, and so unable to carry\non a coherent conversation that we discreetly took our leave after a few\nminutes. It was clear that the New York Review of Books was not going to\npublish our piece, so we published it elsewhere.\n   We found other critics who were deeply unhappy with our piece\u2014on\nboth sides. Was MPD just an iatrogenic (physician-caused) intensification\nof some more mundane affliction, or was it something that could develop\noutside of the enabling ministrations of the therapeutic community? What\nwe particularly wanted to encounter, somehow, was a multiple in the wild,\nsomebody who had not yet been subjected to the leading questions of an\neager therapist. One day I got a call from one of our most helpful\ninformants, Nina Fish Murray, whom I had known for decades, who was\nseeing patients at a Harvard Medical School clinic: \u201cI have found your\nunsullied case of MPD. I\u2019ve just spent a few hours interviewing a young\nwoman who walked into the clinic unannounced and asked for help. I\u2019m\nsure I\u2019m the first therapist she\u2019s ever met, and she struck me as a florid case\nof MPD. The ethics of this are dubious, but I\u2019ve decided to give you and\nNick an opportunity to run into her in her natural habitat to see what you\nmake of her.\u201d Nick and I were soon eagerly devising ways we could\n\u201cindependently\u201d encounter her, spying on her in effect, in hopes of\nproviding her with opportunities to exhibit symptoms during normal social\ninteractions. But then we were told where to find her: she was an underage\n\fprostitute working in Boston\u2019s notorious \u201cCombat Zone\u201d around\nWashington Street. Mission aborted. I was sure that neither Susan nor the\nTufts University research office that was funding the center would approve\nof such a dubious field trip, so we had to abandon the opportunity.\n   In 1990, Nick and I were in Bielefeld, Germany, participating in a\nworkshop on mind and brain, and we paid a visit to the Bethel Foundation,\na famous refuge for patients with epilepsy and other serious brain disorders.\nThis was a diplomatic mission of sorts; we went to pay our respects to the\ngood people at Bethel who had bravely kept the place intact in spite of\nHitler\u2019s attempts to shut it down and exterminate the inhabitants. Our\nmeeting with the director in his office was interrupted by a telephone call to\nhim about a new patient, out of control and threatening harm to both herself\nand others. He apologized for the interruption and briefly described her\nsymptoms: it sounded to us like florid MPD, a condition unknown to the\ndirector, and\u2014tantalizingly\u2014she was an illiterate young woman from an\nisolated mountain village, where she could almost certainly never have\nheard of Sybil or The Three Faces of Eve or any other MPD memes. We\nexplained our interest to the director, and he said he thought he could\narrange for us to question her with interpreters as soon as she calmed down.\nAlas, she died of an inoperable brain tumor before we had a chance to\ninterview her. So to this day we are uncertain about the degree to which this\ncondition\u2014which is a perfectly real affliction\u2014always depends on the\namplification of suggestions made available through the reigning\nmemosphere.\n   The aftermath of the satanic-cult elaborations of MPD in the 1980s was\ninstructive: the annual conferences were abandoned, and some therapists\nwere successfully sued for malpractice, or fined, or lost their licenses to\npractice. My recent perusal of the literature on DID shows that the\ncontroversy about the condition still simmers, which is not surprising when\nyou consider that even professional therapists are susceptible to sensational\nnarratives of abuse that may never have happened. For a while, a group of\nardent believers supported a newsletter, photocopied and stapled, entitled\nS4OS, short for Speaking for Our Selves, with pieces and artwork by and for\nmultiples. Many of the stories were deeply moving, and occasionally\n\fcomical\u2014one author claimed not to have accepted her diagnosis until she\ndiscovered that one of her alters had been under treatment with another\ntherapist! Nick and I had thought their title was an excellent synopsis of the\ncondition and adopted it as the title of our article. Some of our critics were\nshocked that we were so skeptical of many of the accounts that were\nflooding the literature, and some were shocked that we didn\u2019t dismiss the\nwhole phenomenon outright as some strange contagion of misdiagnosis and\nmalpractice. We figured we\u2019d probably hit the nail on the head: it\u2019s a real\ncondition, with real suffering, but it is fostered by potent and variable social\ninfluences.\n    At about this time, the great British neurobiologist and science\ncommunicator Colin Blakemore was organizing a television documentary\nseries on the mind and invited Nick and me to participate, but when we said\nwe wanted to include a section on MPD he protested vigorously that it was\nall metaphysical rubbish. I replied that I thought he was making an error of\narithmetic. Arithmetic? How so? \u201cYou have no problem with one self per\nbrain; why should two or three or four be any more dubious?\u201d He got the\npoint but refused to cover the topic in the documentary.\n    When Nick first arrived at the center, he spotted an offprint of mine in\nwhich I queried a claim by AI pioneer Allen Newell by citing my \u201cJulie\nChristie problem.\u201d Allen had a theory of semantics for computer systems\nthat worked fine for internal computer states and numbers but not much\nelse; if the line of code named a subroutine, executing that line should bring\nup the subroutine; if it said \u201c\u221a9\u201d the program should give you \u201caccess to\u201d 3,\netcetera.

{"paragraph": "W    HEN   THE MIND\u2019S I CAME OUT, DOUG WAS WRITING a monthly column for\nScientific American, following in the footsteps of his friend Martin Gardner,\nwhose famous monthly column \u201cMathematical Games\u201d was anagrammed\nby Doug into \u201cMetamagical Themas.\u201d Some of these are classics, especially\nhis columns on what he called the Luring Lottery and his primers on Lisp,\nthe computer language of AI. But his most influential column was certainly\nhis introduction to America of Rubik\u2019s Cube in March 1981. With some\nsignificant help from Doug, I mastered a set of moves\u2014algorithms, in\neffect\u2014for solving the cube and delighted in honing my skill and teaching\nothers how to do the moves.\n   I got to play Johnny Appleseed with my Rubik\u2019s Cube that March, when\nI managed to squeeze in a trip to Prague\u2014still behind the Iron Curtain, of\ncourse\u2014to give a talk to philosophers who had been ousted by the Soviets\nfrom their positions in Charles University and were keeping the lamp of\nlearning lit in Prague by meeting informally in people\u2019s flats. This politico-\nphilosophical project was organized by the Jan Hus Educational Foundation\nin London, started the previous summer by Oxford philosophers and largely\nrun by Kathleen Wilkes, an Oxford philosopher who had a deep\ninvolvement in academic-freedom projects in Eastern Europe. I had put my\nname in as somebody who would like to give some talks, and just had to\nwait until I could find some European host to pay for my travel. This came\n\fup when I was invited to a Dahlem Conference in Berlin on animal\nintelligence. I didn\u2019t expect the Dahlem Conference to be a major event in\nmy life but merely a convenient way to get to Prague. I could travel to\nEurope a few days early to shed my jet lag in Prague before going on to\nBerlin. I was sent a list of questions to ask the various participants in the\nclandestine meetings, information about the visitor who would be following\nme, and a number of papers to leave with them, including a copy of the\npaper by the next visitor, so they would have a chance to translate them into\nCzech for the group, as they had translated my papers sent in by the\nprevious visitor. It was important not to let this information fall into the\nhands of the people who would be scrutinizing me when I arrived at the\nborder, and I wasn\u2019t sure I could memorize all of it, so I made up a dummy\npage of footnotes, which I stapled to a paper of my own I was bringing in.\nA footnote that read \u201c7. Havelock, A., \u2018Three solutions to the Canal\nproblem,\u2019 p. 235\u201d might mean meet Havel at 3 p.m. on Canal Street,\nnumber 235, and so forth. Spycraft! Such an adventure!\n   The authorities actually knew about the meetings of these underground\nfaculties, and tolerated them, but you didn\u2019t want to give them extra\ninformation about meetings outside the seminar setting, which they could\nthen use to identify individuals or other meetings. I was met, not at the\nairport but on a minor bridge, by my contact, and he showed me a place to\nmeet him later, after I\u2019d checked into my dreary Soviet-era hotel, so we\ncould go off on a round of errands before my talks. The host of the seminar\nwas Ladislav Hejd\u00e1nek, an activist who had been fired from the university\nbut met regularly with groups of philosophers. The point of these meetings\nwas not to plan political action but to ensure as much as possible that young\nCzech philosophy students could get an education while Charles University\nwas filled with apparatchiks\u2014political hacks of no talent or qualifications.\nAfter my talks, we\u2019d go out for a beer and some supper, and there I showed\noff my Rubik\u2019s Cube. Pretty soon others in the restaurant were crowding\naround to see and handle this amazing object and then challenge me to\nsolve it.\n   When it came time for me to fly to Berlin for the Dahlem Conference, I\ndecided that it wouldn\u2019t be safe to go to the airport, although I had my\n\fticket. It turned out that my concern about showing up at the airport with\nillicit baggage was prescient. A few months later, Jacques Derrida gave a\ntalk to the underground seminar in Prague and the authorities planted drugs\nin his suitcase to be \u201cdiscovered\u201d by customs officials at the airport when\nhe left. It turned into a comedy of errors when the customs officials couldn\u2019t\nfind the drugs that they had been told would be in his luggage and had to\nmake a few phone calls to learn where to look, and eventually they found\nthem and whisked Derrida off to jail, charged with drug smuggling. The\nFrench foreign minister was promptly informed and swung into action\nimmediately, so Derrida was released the next day and on his way back to\nFrance. I doubt that the American secretary of state would have come to my\nrescue as swiftly.\n    I was carrying a lot of first-class sealed mail for Hejd\u00e1nek, who had\nasked me to smuggle it out and mail it from Berlin. I had asked why he\ncouldn\u2019t just give it to a friend to mail anonymously from, say, Bratislava,\nbut he insisted that all first-class mail was being opened and read by the\nauthorities. I found this hard to believe, but it proved true when the Iron\nCurtain collapsed and the extent of surveillance was made public. I doubted\nI could get the mail through the border at the airport, so my last evening in\nPrague I took what was left of my Czech money and treated a charming and\nbeautiful young philosopher to a meal at the fanciest restaurant I could find\nin Prague, a grand old place with a palm court, a strolling violinist, and lots\nof Tokaji wine from Hungary. She then accompanied me to the train station\nand put me on the overnight train to Berlin. (I later learned that Roger\nScruton, who had fallen for this young philosopher, was extremely irritated\nby the fact that on his next visit to Prague, all she could talk about was Dan\nDennett! A small ignoble pleasure for me.)\n    I had purchased a couchette, where I had intended to closet myself and\ntransfer Hejd\u00e1nek\u2019s mail from my attach\u00e9 case to my underwear, but there\nwas no couchette for me; I had to spend the night sitting up in a standard\neight-person compartment. The corridors were filled with police and\nsoldiers, so I didn\u2019t dare take my attach\u00e9 case to the restroom in the\ncorridor. What to do? I waited, hoping the other people in the compartment\nwould fall asleep, but none did, and as I heard the train begin to slow down\n\ffor the border between Czechoslovakia and East Germany, I knew I had to\nact. Looking all the strangers in the eye, I got up, pulled my attach\u00e9 case\ndown, opened it, and began stuffing the mail into my underwear in front of\nthem all. Nobody said a word. One old woman gave me a slight nod. When\nthe Grenzpolizei (the border police) opened the compartment door, they\nimmediately began grilling me, asking to see my passport and carefully\ngoing through my luggage. They found a little bit of Czech money, which\nwas not to be taken from the country, in my wallet, and they confiscated\nthat, over my protestations. And they noted that I didn\u2019t have a\nTransitvisum, a special visa for crossing to Berlin through East Germany. I\nprofessed ignorance about this, and eventually they left, never having patted\nme down. A few faint smiles greeted me from other passengers.\n    When I arrived in Berlin, at about 7:00 a.m., I had to get to West Berlin,\nwhich I managed through the Friedrichstrasse underground station gate, in\nthe company of hundreds of East German charladies, who were allowed to\nclean offices in West Berlin every day while leaving their families hostage\non the other side of the Wall. Needless to say, I was conspicuous, but\nsomehow, I managed to get passed through into West Berlin. I had told\nJerry Fodor, who was also attending the Dahlem meeting, that if he hadn\u2019t\nseen me by 8:00 a.m. he should call Susan, and if he hadn\u2019t seen me by 9:00\na.m. he should call the American embassy. I found him pacing nervously in\nthe lobby of our fine hotel in Berlin, looking at his watch and ready to make\nhis first duty call. We were both relieved. I mailed off the letters at the hotel\ndesk, had a shower in my room, and was ready for the day at the Dahlem\nCenter down the street.\n    Dahlem Conferences were remarkable events, designed to introduce\nyoung German scientists to the best researchers in the world for intensive\nfive-day meetings. The young Germans did not get to say anything or even\nsit at the big tables with the guests, but they could take notes. Each\nconference was divided into groups, with a rapporteur, a younger\nresearcher who was responsible for taking voluminous notes and then\nboiling them down overnight into a draft of a report from each working\ngroup, which would be printed and duplicated and in front of every\nparticipant for editing and discussion on the morning of the final day. While\n\fthe rest of the members of the group went off to the opera or a concert, the\nrapporteur, watched over by a zealous staff member, would be prodded and\ncajoled into a great writing labor and not allowed to go to bed until it was\nfinished! Robert Seyfarth, the primatologist, was the rapporteur for my\ngroup, and in return for his labors he was entitled to come to another\nDahlem Conference of his choosing, without any duties. The Germans\nknew how to run a tight ship, and the combination of fine hotel, excellent\nfood, entertainment every evening, and plenty of clerical assistance kept\neveryone on their toes. There was also a cadre of young women standing\naround the room writing on clipboards who were in fact discreet observers\nreporting to the conference director, Silke Bernhard, about who was paying\nattention to whom, who was being disruptive or at risk of falling asleep,\nwho needed to speak English more slowly and clearly. When one of the\nAmericans in our group got a little rude and aggressive, I was mulling over\nhow to speak to him in private and encourage him to adjust his manner, but\nwhen the session resumed after lunch, he was all politeness and gentleness.\nSilke had spoken to him.\n   To my surprise and delight, the meeting was a gold mine of information\nand insights. Something I noticed the first day was that the primatologists\nand bird experts and other ethologists presenting at the meeting were all\nuncomfortable with the strict behavioristic language they had been taught to\nuse. They wanted to be \u201ccognitive\u201d but weren\u2019t sure how to do it. I wasn\u2019t\nmyself a main speaker at the meeting, but I decided to plunge in and explain\nhow to use the intentional stance to describe and explain and predict\nbehavior. The trick was to use the rationality assumption of the stance as a\nlever: If the animals really did believe that p and wanted to X, they ought to\ndo Y when confronted with evidence that q\u2014that\u2019s the rational move under\nthose circumstances. Do they do Y? The ethologists got it almost instantly\nand bombarded me with questions and suggestions. Peter Marler, the great\nbirdsong interpreter at Rockefeller University, challenged me: If this\nintentional stance is any good, shouldn\u2019t it help us design experiments?\n\u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d I replied, and a group of us passed up the sumptuous lunch on\noffer in favor of some sandwiches that were brought in, and we sat down\nand sketched designs of whole suites of experiments on chimpanzees,\n\fpiping plovers, chickens, vervet monkeys, and baboons. As Jeremy Cherfas,\nan English science journalist attending the meeting, said later in the day, \u201cI\nhave never seen a meme spread so swiftly and so effectively!\u201d I was thrilled\nof course, but Jerry Fodor did his best to dampen my enthusiasm. \u201cYour\nintentional stance is really just double-distilled adaptationism, and haven\u2019t\nyou heard? Gould and Lewontin have decisively refuted adaptationism in\nevolutionary theory.\u201d I had not heard of the famous article by Stephen Jay\nGould and Richard Lewontin, but it went to the top of my \u201cmust read right\naway\u201d list.\n   I should mention three other important moments from that meeting. Pat\nChurchland, who was the third philosopher attending, convinced me to skip\nout of the tag end of one session and walk down the street to the zoo, where\nwe listened to the howler monkeys and watched the gibbons perform their\nastounding acrobatics with what appeared to be nonchalance. Watching real\nanimals can be a treat after a day of listening to people talk about watching\nreal animals. I also got a valuable insight into researcher bias: Sue Savage-\nRumbaugh, who later became quite famous for her work with bonobos and\nlanguage, was telling us about her chimpanzees Sherman and Austin and\ntheir cooperative and communicative behavior. She had videotapes that she\nhadn\u2019t had time to show and asked if any of us wanted to skip lunch so we\ncould see them and discuss them with her. I did, and so did a few others.\nShe showed us the videotapes, and what struck me forcefully was that she\nwas \u201cseeing\u201d these chimps doing things that the rest of us couldn\u2019t see or\ncouldn\u2019t be confident we were seeing. The guilelessness with which she\nenthusiastically narrated her videotapes showed that she was honestly\nconvinced that it was plain obvious what these animals intended,\nunderstood, knew. But it wasn\u2019t. You must have independent interpreters\nwho have no stake in the verdicts reached. Sometimes this is next to\nimpossible\u2014in anthropology as well as in ethology and psychology.\n   The third big moment for me was learning about the British psychologist\nwho had worked with Dian Fossey, and who had written a remarkable\npaper, \u201cThe Social Function of Intellect\u201d (another 1976 paper!), about how\nintelligence might have evolved primarily to permit interactions among\nmembers of social species: Nicholas Humphrey. Nick wasn\u2019t there, but his\n\fname was on everybody\u2019s lips, and I looked forward eagerly to meeting\nhim. A year or so later in London I did, at lunch with Jeremy Cherfas, and\nwe have been dear friends ever since, working together and disagreeing\nstubbornly with each other.\n    So what I had envisioned as a useful ticket to Prague became in short\norder a major turning point in my life, the first significant step of which was\nmy target article in Behavioral and Brain Sciences, \u201cIntentional Systems in\nCognitive Ethology: The \u2018Panglossian Paradigm\u2019 Defended\u201d (1983), in\nwhich I elaborated the ideas from the Dahlem workshop and included the\nfirst salvo in my critique of Gould and Lewontin and their famous attack on\nadaptationism.
