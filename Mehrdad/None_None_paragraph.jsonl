Millikan\u2019s neologism, unicepts, are like\nconcepts in that they anchor the meaning of words for individual speakers,\nbut each speaker has her own way of coming to her current set of uni-\ncepts, and it is in\ufb02uenced by features of her life that she may be largely\noblivious to. Unicepts are the (ultimately neurological) structures based\non unitrackers that enable us to track regularities in the world, the Gibso-\nnian a\ufb00ordances in our worlds that are worth attending to, and they are\nidiosyncratic, relying on the \u2018clumpiness\u2019 of the world to provide su\ufb03cient\nlandmarks so that people can get on the same page most of the time\nwithout di\ufb03culty.\n\f                                                                                     INQUIRY          629", "location": 7791}
{"paragraph": "recognize as a philosophical syndrome: the inability of many philosophers\nto live with some of the counterintuitive doctrines of some of their heroes.\nLong ago I realized that many self-styled Wittgensteinians couldn\u2019t recon-\ncile themselves to the ominously \u2018behavioristic\u2019 implications of his beetle\nin the box (which I have always endorsed \u2013 see my discussion in Con-\nsciousness Explained (1991a), pp. 462\u2013463), and Richard shows that a\nsimilar discomfort haunts those who admire Quine for his ambitious\nattempt, mainly in Word and Object\u2019 (Quine 1951), but also, of course, in\n\u2018Two Dogmas of Empiricism\u2019 (Quine 1960), to \u2018regiment\u2019 language, the\nultimate goal of so much Cartesian theorizing. Indeterminacy of\nmeaning? Fie! How can we accept any indeterminacy of meaning if we\nare to Euclidify the \ufb01eld? Quine has to be wrong about that! Richard\nshows that we can do this as calmly as rigorous Darwinian biologists\naccept the indeterminacy of species boundaries. The empirical world\nhas, happily, enough regularity, enough \u2018real patterns\u2019 (Dennett, 1991b)\nin it, to anchor our meanings well enough to give us time to build\nscience using our shared understanding. As Richard says,\n  I think Quine\u2019s skepticism is overdone. I agree that there is a healthy indetermi-\n  nacy as to whether, for example, samples of green tea are things of which\n  \u2018water\u2019 as it\u2019s used in the everyday is true. But I reject Quine\u2019s linguistic behavior-\n  ism. Psychological structures like prototypes and schemata as well as (innate)\n  psychological states involved in the analysis of perception and the generation\n  of \u2018core concepts\u2019 are shared by all normal humans. They are associated in the\n  course of language learning with both lexical items and more complex phrases.\n  This association helps ground translation, I would say, in a way that supports\n  our everyday practices of interpretation without o\ufb00ering support to the idea\n  that \u2018Pupkins\u2019 means something like, \u2018Oh, lo, an animated piece of the sum of\n  the canine world\u2019. This and what I called in this section causal constraints on\n  translation, I would say, reduces but does not eliminate referential indetermi-\n  nacy. (p. 115)", "location": 3139}

But consider how her assault on what she called \u2018meaning rational-\nism\u2019 in 1984 presages Richard\u2019s claims:\n      We must be willing to discover that, just as we cannot know apriori or with Car-\n      tesian certainty whether any particular thing we think or say is true, so we cannot\n      know a priori or with Cartesian certainty that in seeming to think or talk about\n      something we are thinking or talking about\u2014anything at all. We cannot know\n      a priori that we mean. Nor can we know a priori or with Cartesian certainty\n      what it is that we are thinking or talking about. Further, we cannot tell just by\n      armchair re\ufb02ection whether or not two terms in our idiolect are synonymous,\n      whether a single term is ambiguous, or whether any particular state of a\ufb00airs\n      is or is not \u2018logically possible\u2019 in any interesting or useful sense of that term.

{"paragraph": "The Lamarckian heresy is properly restricted to multicellular organisms\nthat distinguish somatic cells from germ line cells. In viruses, for\nexample, there is really no useful distinction between mutation and the\nacquisition of new traits. If meanings are considered to be memes, unliv-\ning but evolving \u2018symbionts\u2019 of language users, the misdirection disap-\npears. When Jane Q. Public\u2019s meaning of the word \u2018marriage\u2019 evolves \u2013\nperhaps without her realizing it \u2013 this is no more Lamarckian than her\nunwitting acquisition of a mutant strain of Covid-19.

{"paragraph": "A fond farewell to Cartesian linguistics\nIt\u2019s been a long productive ride, but it\u2019s time to get o\ufb00 the bandwagon\nand recognize that the Cartesian tradition, in analytic philosophy of\nlanguage and mind and linguistics, has played itself out in a constructive\nand honorable way: by being both rigorous and ambitious, it has uncov-\nered the contradictions in its own grand scheme, and helped lay the foun-\ndations for a more naturalistic understanding of meaning. It is hard to\nimagine how Einsteinian physics could have ever come into existence\nwithout being able to use Newtonian physics as a well-equipped base\ncamp, and the emerging view of meanings that Richard so patiently\nand exhaustively extracts from the analytic tradition is similarly illumi-\nnated by its obsolescent concepts. Essentialism is always appealing to\ntheoreticians, especially to philosophers, because it promises what\nmight be called the Euclidi\ufb01cation of theory: a set of de\ufb01nitions and\naxioms from which theorems might be deduced and then triumphantly\ncon\ufb01rmed empirically, just like geometry, the ideal of knowledge ever\nsince Socrates and the slave boy. Wouldn\u2019t it be wonderful to have a\ntheory of meaning that was full of rigorous proofs, thanks to a starter\nkit of ingenious idealizations!\n    That dream has been the inspiration of philosophers who have clung\nto Frege and Russell and their brilliant successors for more than a\ncentury, and one of the most interesting features of Richard\u2019s book \u2013 to\nme \u2013 is how hard he has to labor to get and hold the attention of\nthose of his colleagues whose natural reaction to his arguments for\nthese innovations is so often an inability to suspend disbelief long\nenough to consider a position.

{"paragraph": "It is natural to describe the members of our little family as literally sharing a\n      vocabulary. Saying that, we can\u2019t identify the words of the shared vocabulary\n      with feature sets\u2014collections of morphological, phonological, syntactic, and\n      semantic properties manifested in the user\u2019s speech. For if that\u2019s what words\n      are, our family members do not have common words for \u2018co\ufb00ee\u2019, \u2018eat\u2019, and\n      \u2018mother\u2019. If we are going to describe the family in the natural way, we need\n      to think of words in some other way. What seems apt is to think of them in\n      something like the way that we are taught in high school to think of genes.\n      Genes come in di\ufb00erent \u2018versions\u2019\u2014alleles\u2014and di\ufb00erent members of a\n      species will vary as to which alleles of a particular gene they have. Likewise,\n      words come in di\ufb00erent versions, and Matt, Noah, and Diane have di\ufb00erent ver-\n      sions of the same words. If this is how we think of things, then linguistic indi-\n      viduals\u2014embodied lexicons\u2014are not stable in the way that embodied\n      genomes are, for such things as morphology, phonology, and syntactic and\n      semantic roles in a lexicon change over time.", "location": 13029}

{"paragraph": "I am amused to note that here is another instance of what might be\ncalled the magical use of the de\ufb01nite article by philosophers. David\nChalmers (1995) gave us The Hard Problem, which has tied conscious-\nness researchers in knots for a quarter century because they think\nthey must have a single, shared property that is, well, essential for con-\nsciousness. I have argued that they are bamboozled by the word \u2018the\u2019\njust as magicians were fooled by Ralph Hull\u2019s magic trick, The Tuned\nDeck, which was just a bag of familiar tricks his fellow magicians\nalready all knew, not a Hard Problem (Dennett, 2005, 2013). When phi-\nlosophers speak, as they have since Frege, of The concept of DOG or\nHORSE, they are falling in a similar imagination trap.1 We can each\nhave our own concept (or better, unicept) of DOG and HORSE, and as\nlong as our concepts, like our idiolects, stay in robust consonance\nwith those of our neighbors and associates, we will manage just \ufb01ne.\nWe don\u2019t need to go through the hundreds or thousands of \u2018connota-\ntions\u2019 each of us has for \u2018married\u2019 or \u2018Jew\u2019 sorting them into the (\u2018essen-\ntial\u2019) components of meaning and the historical accidents of association\nand disposition. When evolutionary biologists adopt \u2018population think-\ning\u2019 they don\u2019t have to worry much about the proper distinction\nbetween varieties and subspecies, which individual organisms are\n\u2018wild type\u2019, and which organisms are \u2018sports\u2019 or \u2018mutants\u2019. The sorta\noperator (Dennett, 2013, 2017) can be used responsibly in spite of phi-\nlosophers\u2019 obsessions with \u2018di\ufb00erence-makers\u2019 and other substitutes of\nessences.\n    One of Richard\u2019s insights is an enlargement of Quine\u2019s point about the\ntriviality of stipulative de\ufb01nitions, which create, at best, transient analyti-\ncities. We philosophers are so fond to stipulative de\ufb01nitions in formal\nsystems that we tend to think of them as an ideal, roughly approximated\n(somehow) in natural language, and perhaps even a worthy philosophical\nendeavor. Think how often a philosophical \u2018theory\u2019 of this or that turns\nout to be, on examination, \u2018a system of de\ufb01nitions propounded and\ndefended\u2019 (the subtitle of David Schwayder\u2019s 1965 book). But when we sti-\npulatively de\ufb01ne a term, we launch it into the world as a candidate for\nadoption, and this is a ballistic launch, nothing we can easily control or\nguide as time passes (Richard, pp. 36\u201337). Just think of how Dawkins\u2019\nrather careful de\ufb01nition of his coinage \u2018meme\u2019 has evolved over the\nyears (Dennett, 2017).", "location": 9079}
