Passage 1:
In Tragedy, however, they still adhere to the historic names; and for this reason: what convinces is the possible; now whereas we are not yet sure as to the possibility of that which has not happened, that which has happened is manifestly possible, else it would not have come to pass.
Author: Aristotle
Option A
Passage 2:
But let the liar and the hypocrite beware of our German music: for in the midst of all our culture it is really the only genuine, pure and purifying fire-spirit from which and towards which, as in the teaching of the great Heraclitus of Ephesus, all things move in a double orbit-all that we now call culture, education, civilisation, must appear some day before the unerring judge, Dionysus.
Author: Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche
Option C
Passage 3:
The faculty of desire, so far as it is determinable only through concepts, _i.e._ to act in conformity with the representation of a purpose, would be the Will.
Author: Immanuel Kant
Option E
Passage 4:
