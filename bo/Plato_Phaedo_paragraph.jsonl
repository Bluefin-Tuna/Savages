Are not all\nthings which have opposites generated out of their opposites? I mean\nsuch things as good and evil, just and unjust--and there are innumerable\nother opposites which are generated out of opposites. And I want to show\nthat in all opposites there is of necessity a similar alternation;\nI mean to say, for example, that anything which becomes greater must\nbecome greater after being less.", "location": 117942}

And yet\nI should deem him a coward who did not prove what is said about them to\nthe uttermost, or whose heart failed him before he had examined them\non every side.

This is a safe and simple answer, which\nescapes the contradictions of greater and less (greater by reason of\nthat which is smaller!), of addition and subtraction, and the other\ndifficulties of relation. These subtleties he is for leaving to wiser\nheads than his own; he prefers to test ideas by the consistency of their\nconsequences, and, if asked to give an account of them, goes back to\nsome higher idea or hypothesis which appears to him to be the best,\nuntil at last he arrives at a resting-place.

{"paragraph": "17. Living in an age when logic was beginning to mould human thought,\nPlato naturally cast his belief in immortality into a logical form. And\nwhen we consider how much the doctrine of ideas was also one of words,\nit is not surprising that he should have fallen into verbal fallacies:\nearly logic is always mistaking the truth of the form for the truth of\nthe matter. It is easy to see that the alternation of opposites is\nnot the same as the generation of them out of each other; and that the\ngeneration of them out of each other, which is the first argument in\nthe Phaedo, is at variance with their mutual exclusion of each other,\nwhether in themselves or in us, which is the last. For even if we admit\nthe distinction which he draws between the opposites and the things\nwhich have the opposites, still individuals fall under the latter class;\nand we have to pass out of the region of human hopes and fears to a\nconception of an abstract soul which is the impersonation of the ideas.\nSuch a conception, which in Plato himself is but half expressed, is\nunmeaning to us, and relative only to a particular stage in the history\nof thought. The doctrine of reminiscence is also a fragment of a former\nworld, which has no place in the philosophy of modern times. But Plato\nhad the wonders of psychology just opening to him, and he had not the\nexplanation of them which is supplied by the analysis of language and\nthe history of the human mind. The question, 'Whence come our abstract\nideas?' he could only answer by an imaginary hypothesis. Nor is it\ndifficult to see that his crowning argument is purely verbal, and is\nbut the expression of an instinctive confidence put into a logical\nform:--'The soul is immortal because it contains a principle of\nimperishableness.' Nor does he himself seem at all to be aware that\nnothing is added to human knowledge by his 'safe and simple answer,'\nthat beauty is the cause of the beautiful; and that he is merely\nreasserting the Eleatic being 'divided by the Pythagorean numbers,'\nagainst the Heracleitean doctrine of perpetual generation. The answer to\nthe 'very serious question' of generation and destruction is really\nthe denial of them. For this he would substitute, as in the Republic, a\nsystem of ideas, tested, not by experience, but by their consequences,\nand not explained by actual causes, but by a higher, that is, a more\ngeneral notion. Consistency with themselves is the only test which is to\nbe applied to them. (Republic, and Phaedo.)", "location": 64647}
{"paragraph": "Then I heard some one reading, as he said, from a book of Anaxagoras,\nthat mind was the disposer and cause of all, and I was delighted at this\nnotion, which appeared quite admirable, and I said to myself: If mind\nis the disposer, mind will dispose all for the best, and put each\nparticular in the best place; and I argued that if any one desired to\nfind out the cause of the generation or destruction or existence of\nanything, he must find out what state of being or doing or suffering was\nbest for that thing, and therefore a man had only to consider the best\nfor himself and others, and then he would also know the worse, since the\nsame science comprehended both. And I rejoiced to think that I had found\nin Anaxagoras a teacher of the causes of existence such as I desired,\nand I imagined that he would tell me first whether the earth is flat or\nround; and whichever was true, he would proceed to explain the cause and\nthe necessity of this being so, and then he would teach me the nature of\nthe best and show that this was best; and if he said that the earth was\nin the centre, he would further explain that this position was the best,\nand I should be satisfied with the explanation given, and not want any\nother sort of cause. And I thought that I would then go on and ask him\nabout the sun and moon and stars, and that he would explain to me their\ncomparative swiftness, and their returnings and various states, active\nand passive, and how all of them were for the best. For I could not\nimagine that when he spoke of mind as the disposer of them, he would\ngive any other account of their being as they are, except that this was\nbest; and I thought that when he had explained to me in detail the cause\nof each and the cause of all, he would go on to explain to me what was\nbest for each and what was good for all. These hopes I would not have\nsold for a large sum of money, and I seized the books and read them as\nfast as I could in my eagerness to know the better and the worse.", "location": 183822}
{"paragraph": "Let us then, in the first place, he said, be careful of allowing or of\nadmitting into our souls the notion that there is no health or soundness\nin any arguments at all. Rather say that we have not yet attained to\nsoundness in ourselves, and that we must struggle manfully and do our\nbest to gain health of mind--you and all other men having regard to the\nwhole of your future life, and I myself in the prospect of death. For at\nthis moment I am sensible that I have not the temper of a philosopher;\nlike the vulgar, I am only a partisan. Now the partisan, when he is\nengaged in a dispute, cares nothing about the rights of the question,\nbut is anxious only to convince his hearers of his own assertions.\nAnd the difference between him and me at the present moment is merely\nthis--that whereas he seeks to convince his hearers that what he says is\ntrue, I am rather seeking to convince myself; to convince my hearers\nis a secondary matter with me. And do but see how much I gain by the\nargument. For if what I say is true, then I do well to be persuaded of\nthe truth, but if there be nothing after death, still, during the short\ntime that remains, I shall not distress my friends with lamentations,\nand my ignorance will not last, but will die with me, and therefore\nno harm will be done. This is the state of mind, Simmias and Cebes, in\nwhich I approach the argument. And I would ask you to be thinking of\nthe truth and not of Socrates: agree with me, if I seem to you to be\nspeaking the truth; or if not, withstand me might and main, that I may\nnot deceive you as well as myself in my enthusiasm, and like the bee,\nleave my sting in you before I die.", "location": 167896}

{"paragraph": "There are some other questions which are disturbing to us because we\nhave no answer to them. What is to become of the animals in a future\nstate? Have we not seen dogs more faithful and intelligent than men,\nand men who are more stupid and brutal than any animals? Does their life\ncease at death, or is there some 'better thing reserved' also for\nthem? They may be said to have a shadow or imitation of morality, and\nimperfect moral claims upon the benevolence of man and upon the justice\nof God. We cannot think of the least or lowest of them, the insect, the\nbird, the inhabitants of the sea or the desert, as having any place in\na future world, and if not all, why should those who are specially\nattached to man be deemed worthy of any exceptional privilege? When we\nreason about such a subject, almost at once we degenerate into nonsense.\nIt is a passing thought which has no real hold on the mind. We may argue\nfor the existence of animals in a future state from the attributes of\nGod, or from texts of Scripture ('Are not two sparrows sold for one\nfarthing?' etc.), but the truth is that we are only filling up the void\nof another world with our own fancies. Again, we often talk about\nthe origin of evil, that great bugbear of theologians, by which they\nfrighten us into believing any superstition. What answer can be made\nto the old commonplace, 'Is not God the author of evil, if he knowingly\npermitted, but could have prevented it?' Even if we assume that the\ninequalities of this life are rectified by some transposition of human\nbeings in another, still the existence of the very least evil if it\ncould have been avoided, seems to be at variance with the love and\njustice of God. And so we arrive at the conclusion that we are carrying\nlogic too far, and that the attempt to frame the world according to a\nrule of divine perfection is opposed to experience and had better be\ngiven up. The case of the animals is our own. We must admit that the\nDivine Being, although perfect himself, has placed us in a state of life\nin which we may work together with him for good, but we are very far\nfrom having attained to it.", "location": 35792}
{"paragraph": "Now these rivers are many, and mighty, and diverse, and there are four\nprincipal ones, of which the greatest and outermost is that called\nOceanus, which flows round the earth in a circle; and in the opposite\ndirection flows Acheron, which passes under the earth through desert\nplaces into the Acherusian lake: this is the lake to the shores of\nwhich the souls of the many go when they are dead, and after waiting an\nappointed time, which is to some a longer and to some a shorter time,\nthey are sent back to be born again as animals. The third river passes\nout between the two, and near the place of outlet pours into a vast\nregion of fire, and forms a lake larger than the Mediterranean Sea,\nboiling with water and mud; and proceeding muddy and turbid, and winding\nabout the earth, comes, among other places, to the extremities of the\nAcherusian Lake, but mingles not with the waters of the lake, and after\nmaking many coils about the earth plunges into Tartarus at a deeper\nlevel. This is that Pyriphlegethon, as the stream is called, which\nthrows up jets of fire in different parts of the earth. The fourth river\ngoes out on the opposite side, and falls first of all into a wild and\nsavage region, which is all of a dark-blue colour, like lapis lazuli;\nand this is that river which is called the Stygian river, and falls into\nand forms the Lake Styx, and after falling into the lake and receiving\nstrange powers in the waters, passes under the earth, winding round\nin the opposite direction, and comes near the Acherusian lake from the\nopposite side to Pyriphlegethon.

And when some one\nbreaks the lyre, or cuts and rends the strings, then he who takes this\nview would argue as you do, and on the same analogy, that the harmony\nsurvives and has not perished--you cannot imagine, he would say, that\nthe lyre without the strings, and the broken strings themselves which\nare mortal remain, and yet that the harmony, which is of heavenly and\nimmortal nature and kindred, has perished--perished before the mortal.\nThe harmony must still be somewhere, and the wood and strings will decay\nbefore anything can happen to that. The thought, Socrates, must have\noccurred to your own mind that such is our conception of the soul;\nand that when the body is in a manner strung and held together by the\nelements of hot and cold, wet and dry, then the soul is the harmony or\ndue proportionate admixture of them. But if so, whenever the strings of\nthe body are unduly loosened or overstrained through disease or other\ninjury, then the soul, though most divine, like other harmonies of music\nor of works of art, of course perishes at once, although the material\nremains of the body may last for a considerable time, until they are\neither decayed or burnt. And if any one maintains that the soul, being\nthe harmony of the elements of the body, is first to perish in that\nwhich is called death, how shall we answer him?", "location": 156067}
{"paragraph": "18. To deal fairly with such arguments, they should be translated as\nfar as possible into their modern equivalents. 'If the ideas of men are\neternal, their souls are eternal, and if not the ideas, then not the\nsouls.' Such an argument stands nearly in the same relation to Plato and\nhis age, as the argument from the existence of God to immortality among\nourselves. 'If God exists, then the soul exists after death; and if\nthere is no God, there is no existence of the soul after death.' For\nthe ideas are to his mind the reality, the truth, the principle of\npermanence, as well as of intelligence and order in the world. When\nSimmias and Cebes say that they are more strongly persuaded of the\nexistence of ideas than they are of the immortality of the soul, they\nrepresent fairly enough the order of thought in Greek philosophy. And we\nmight say in the same way that we are more certain of the existence\nof God than we are of the immortality of the soul, and are led by the\nbelief in the one to a belief in the other. The parallel, as Socrates\nwould say, is not perfect, but agrees in as far as the mind in either\ncase is regarded as dependent on something above and beyond herself. The\nanalogy may even be pressed a step further: 'We are more certain of our\nideas of truth and right than we are of the existence of God, and\nare led on in the order of thought from one to the other.' Or more\ncorrectly: 'The existence of right and truth is the existence of God,\nand can never for a moment be separated from Him.'", "location": 67134}

In the course of my life I have\noften had intimations in dreams 'that I should compose music.' The same\ndream came to me sometimes in one form, and sometimes in another, but\nalways saying the same or nearly the same words: 'Cultivate and make\nmusic,' said the dream. And hitherto I had imagined that this was only\nintended to exhort and encourage me in the study of philosophy, which\nhas been the pursuit of my life, and is the noblest and best of music.\nThe dream was bidding me do what I was already doing, in the same way\nthat the competitor in a race is bidden by the spectators to run when he\nis already running. But I was not certain of this, for the dream might\nhave meant music in the popular sense of the word, and being under\nsentence of death, and the festival giving me a respite, I thought that\nit would be safer for me to satisfy the scruple, and, in obedience to\nthe dream, to compose a few verses before I departed. And first I made\na hymn in honour of the god of the festival, and then considering that a\npoet, if he is really to be a poet, should not only put together words,\nbut should invent stories, and that I have no invention, I took some\nfables of Aesop, which I had ready at hand and which I knew--they were\nthe first I came upon--and turned them into verse.

This was her original state; and\nthen, as I was saying, and as the lovers of knowledge are well aware,\nphilosophy, seeing how terrible was her confinement, of which she was\nto herself the cause, received and gently comforted her and sought to\nrelease her, pointing out that the eye and the ear and the other senses\nare full of deception, and persuading her to retire from them, and\nabstain from all but the necessary use of them, and be gathered up and\ncollected into herself, bidding her trust in herself and her own pure\napprehension of pure existence, and to mistrust whatever comes to her\nthrough other channels and is subject to variation; for such things\nare visible and tangible, but what she sees in her own nature is\nintelligible and invisible. And the soul of the true philosopher thinks\nthat she ought not to resist this deliverance, and therefore abstains\nfrom pleasures and desires and pains and fears, as far as she is\nable; reflecting that when a man has great joys or sorrows or fears or\ndesires, he suffers from them, not merely the sort of evil which might\nbe anticipated--as for example, the loss of his health or property which\nhe has sacrificed to his lusts--but an evil greater far, which is the\ngreatest and worst of all evils, and one of which he never thinks.", "location": 148630}
