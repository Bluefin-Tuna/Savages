"Title: The Essence of Christianity"
"Author: Feuerbach"
{"paragraph": "It is indeed worthy of remark that the idea of the empirical\nexistence of God has been perfectly developed in modern times,\nin which empiricism and materialism in general have arrived at\ntheir full blow. It is true that even in the original, simple\nreligious mind, God is an empirical existence to be found in a place,\nthough above the earth. But here this conception has not so naked,\nso prosaic a significance; the imagination identifies again the\nexternal God with the soul of man. The imagination is, in general,\nthe true place of an existence which is absent, not present to\nthe senses, though nevertheless sensational in its essence. [162]\nOnly the imagination solves the contradiction in an existence which\nis at once sensational and not sensational; only the imagination\nis the preservative from atheism. In the imagination existence has\nsensational effects,--existence affirms itself as a power; with the\nessence of sensational existence the imagination associates also the\nphenomena of sensational existence. Where the existence of God is a\nliving truth, an object on which the imagination exercises itself,\nthere also appearances of God are believed in. [163] Where, on the\ncontrary, the fire of the religious imagination is extinct, where\nthe sensational effects or appearances necessarily connected with an\nessentially sensational existence cease, there the existence becomes\na dead, self-contradictory existence, which falls irrecoverably into\nthe negation of atheism.", "location": 461800}

{"paragraph": "That which makes a being what it is, is its talent, its power,\nits wealth, its adornment. How can it possibly hold its existence\nnon-existence, its wealth poverty, its talent incapacity? If the\nplants had eyes, taste, and judgment, each plant would declare its\nown flower the most beautiful; for its comprehension, its taste,\nwould reach no farther than its natural power of production. What\nthe productive power of its nature has brought forth as the highest,\nthat must also its taste, its judgment, recognise and affirm as the\nhighest. What the nature affirms, the understanding, the taste, the\njudgment, cannot deny; otherwise the understanding, the judgment, would\nno longer be the understanding and judgment of this particular being,\nbut of some other. The measure of the nature is also the measure of\nthe understanding. If the nature is limited, so also is the feeling,\nso also is the understanding. But to a limited being its limited\nunderstanding is not felt to be a limitation; on the contrary,\nit is perfectly happy and contented with this understanding; it\nregards it, praises and values it, as a glorious, divine power; and\nthe limited understanding, on its part, values the limited nature\nwhose understanding it is. Each is exactly adapted to the other;\nhow should they be at issue with each other? A being's understanding\nis its sphere of vision. As far as thou seest, so far extends thy\nnature; and conversely. The eye of the brute reaches no farther than\nits needs, and its nature no farther than its needs. And so far as\nthy nature reaches, so far reaches thy unlimited self-consciousness,\nso far art thou God. The discrepancy between the understanding and the\nnature, between the power of conception and the power of production\nin the human consciousness, on the one hand, is merely of individual\nsignificance and has not a universal application; and, on the other\nhand, it is only apparent. He who, having written a bad poem, knows\nit to be bad, is in his intelligence, and therefore in his nature,\nnot so limited as he who, having written a bad poem, admires it and\nthinks it good.", "location": 49210}
{"paragraph": "The more judicious among them, however, think and say nothing definite\nabout heaven or the future world in general, on the ground that it is\ninconceivable, that it can only be thought of by us according to the\nstandard of this world, a standard not applicable to the other. All\nconceptions of heaven here below are, they allege, mere images,\nwhereby man represents to himself that future, the nature of which\nis unknown to him, but the existence of which is certain. It is just\nso with God. The existence of God, it is said, is certain; but what\nhe is, or how he exists, is inscrutable. But he who speaks thus has\nalready driven the future world out of his head; he still holds it\nfast, either because he does not think at all about such matters, or\nbecause it is still a want of his heart; but, preoccupied with real\nthings, he thrusts it as far as possible out of his sight; he denies\nwith his head what he affirms with his heart; for it is to deny the\nfuture life, to deprive it of the qualities by which alone it is a real\nand effective object for man. Quality is not distinct from existence;\nquality is nothing but real existence. Existence without quality is a\nchimera, a spectre. Existence is first made known to me by quality;\nnot existence first, and after that quality. The doctrines that God\nis not to be known or defined, and that the nature of the future life\nis inscrutable, are therefore not originally religious doctrines;\non the contrary, they are the products of irreligion while still in\nbondage to religion, or rather hiding itself behind religion; and\nthey are so for this reason, that originally the existence of God is\nposited only with a definite conception of God, the existence of a\nfuture life only with a definite conception of that life. Thus to the\nChristian, only his own paradise, the paradise which has Christian\nqualities, is a certainty, not the paradise of the Mahometan or the\nElysium of the Greeks. The primary certainty is everywhere quality;\nexistence follows of course when once quality is certain. In the New\nTestament we find no proofs or general propositions such as: there\nis a God, there is a heavenly life; we find only qualities of the\nheavenly life adduced;--\"in heaven they marry not.\" Naturally;--it\nmay be answered,--because the existence of God and of heaven is\npresupposed. But here reflection introduces a distinction of which\nthe religious sentiment knows nothing. Doubtless the existence is\npresupposed, but only because the quality is itself existence, because\nthe inviolate religious feeling lives only in the quality, just as to\nthe natural man the real existence, the thing in itself, lies only in\nthe quality which he perceives. Thus in the passage above cited from\nthe New Testament, the virgin or rather sexless life is presupposed\nas the true life, which, however, necessarily becomes a future one,\nbecause the actual life contradicts the ideal of the true life. But\nthe certainty of this future life lies only in the certainty of its\nqualities, as those of the true, highest life, adequate to the ideal.", "location": 403588}

{"paragraph": "It may be objected to the import here assigned to the Incarnation,\nthat the Christian Incarnation is altogether peculiar, that at least\nit is different (which is quite true in certain respects, as will\nhereafter be apparent) from the incarnations of the heathen deities,\nwhether Greek or Indian. These latter are mere products of men or\ndeified men; but in Christianity is given the idea of the true God;\nhere the union of the divine nature with the human is first significant\nand \"speculative.\" Jupiter transforms himself into a bull; the heathen\nincarnations are mere fancies. In paganism there is no more in the\nnature of God than in his incarnate manifestation; in Christianity,\non the contrary, it is God, a separate, superhuman being, who appears\nas man. But this objection is refuted by the remark already made,\nthat even the premiss of the Christian Incarnation contains the human\nnature. God loves man; moreover God has a Son; God is a father; the\nrelations of humanity are not excluded from God; the human is not\nremote from God, not unknown to him. Thus here also there is nothing\nmore in the nature of God than in the incarnate manifestation of\nGod. In the Incarnation religion only confesses, what in reflection\non itself, as theology, it will not admit; namely, that God is an\naltogether human being. The Incarnation, the mystery of the \"God-man,\"\nis therefore no mysterious composition of contraries, no synthetic\nfact, as it is regarded by the speculative religious philosophy,\nwhich has a particular delight in contradiction; it is an analytic\nfact,--a human word with a human meaning. If there be a contradiction\nhere, it lies before the incarnation and out of it; in the union of\nprovidence, of love, with deity; for if this love is a real love,\nit is not essentially different from our love,--there are only our\nlimitations to be abstracted from it; and thus the Incarnation is only\nthe strongest, deepest, most palpable, open-hearted expression of this\nprovidence, this love. Love knows not how to make its object happier\nthan by rejoicing it with its personal presence, by letting itself be\nseen. To see the invisible benefactor face to face is the most ardent\ndesire of love. To see is a divine act. Happiness lies in the mere\nsight of the beloved one. The glance is the certainty of love. And\nthe Incarnation has no other significance, no other effect, than the\nindubitable certitude of the love of God to man. Love remains, but the\nIncarnation upon the earth passes away: the appearance was limited by\ntime and place, accessible to few; but the essence, the nature which\nwas manifested, is eternal and universal. We can no longer believe\nin the manifestation for its own sake, but only for the sake of the\nthing manifested; for to us there remains no immediate presence but\nthat of love.", "location": 153941}
{"paragraph": "To give an example. \"When I believe that the human nature alone\nhas suffered for me, Christ is a poor Saviour to me: in that case,\nhe needs a Saviour himself.\" And thus, out of the need for salvation\nis postulated something transcending human nature, a being different\nfrom man. But no sooner is this being postulated than there arises\nthe yearning of man after himself, after his own nature, and man\nis immediately re-established. \"Here is God, who is not man and\nnever yet became man. But this is not a God for me.... That would\nbe a miserable Christ to me, who ... should be nothing but a purely\nseparate God and divine person ... without humanity. No, my friend;\nwhere thou givest me God, thou must give me humanity too.\" [26]", "location": 131552}
{"paragraph": "It is the greatest inconsequence to reject the idea of a God who\ncan be determined by prayer, that is, by the force of feeling, as an\nunworthy anthropomorphic idea. If we once believe in a being who is\nan object of veneration, an object of prayer, an object of affection,\nwho is providential, who takes care of man,--in a Providence, which is\nnot conceivable without love,--in a being, therefore, who is loving,\nwhose motive of action is love; we also believe in a being, who has,\nif not an anatomical, yet a psychical human heart. The religious mind,\nas has been said, places everything in God, excepting that alone which\nit despises. The Christians certainly gave their God no attributes\nwhich contradicted their own moral ideas, but they gave him without\nhesitation, and of necessity, the emotions of love, of compassion. And\nthe love which the religious mind places in God is not an illusory,\nimaginary love, but a real, true love. God is loved and loves again;\nthe divine love is only human love made objective, affirming itself. In\nGod love is absorbed in itself as its own ultimate truth.", "location": 152844}

{"paragraph": "But that there are in fact only two Persons in the Trinity, the\nthird representing, as has been said, only love, is involved in\nthis, that to the strict idea of love two suffice. With two we have\nthe principle of multiplicity and all its essential results. Two\nis the principle of multiplicity, and can therefore stand as its\ncomplete substitute. If several Persons were posited, the force\nof love would only be weakened--it would be dispersed. But love\nand the heart are identical; the heart is no special power; it is\nthe man who loves, and in so far as he loves. The second Person is\ntherefore the self-assertion of the human heart as the principle of\nduality, of participated life,--it is warmth; the Father is light,\nalthough light was chiefly a predicate of the Son, because in him the\nGodhead first became clear, comprehensible. But notwithstanding this,\nlight as a superterrestrial element may be ascribed to the Father,\nthe representative of the Godhead as such, the cold being of the\nintelligence; and warmth, as a terrestrial element, to the Son. God\nas the Son first gives warmth to man; here God, from an object of\nthe intellectual eye, of the indifferent sense of light, becomes\nan object of feeling, of affection, of enthusiasm, of rapture;\nbut only because the Son is himself nothing else than the glow of\nlove, enthusiasm. [45] God as the Son is the primitive incarnation,\nthe primitive self-renunciation of God, the negation of God in God;\nfor as the Son he is a finite being, because he exists ab alio, he\nhas a source, whereas the Father has no source, he exists \u00e0 se. Thus\nin the second Person the essential attribute of the Godhead, the\nattribute of self-existence, is given up. But God the Father himself\nbegets the Son; thus he renounces his rigorous, exclusive divinity;\nhe humiliates, lowers himself, evolves within himself the principle\nof finiteness, of dependent existence; in the Son he becomes man,\nnot indeed, in the first instance, as to the outward form, but as\nto the inward nature. And for this reason it is as the Son that God\nfirst becomes the object of man, the object of feeling, of the heart.", "location": 179818}

{"paragraph": "Man distinguishes himself from Nature. This distinction of his\nis his God: the distinguishing of God from Nature is nothing\nelse than the distinguishing of man from Nature. The antithesis\nof pantheism and personalism resolves itself into the question:\nIs the nature of man transcendental or immanent, supranaturalistic\nor naturalistic? The speculations and controversies concerning the\npersonality or impersonality of God are therefore fruitless, idle,\nuncritical, and odious; for the speculatists, especially those who\nmaintain the personality, do not call the thing by the right name;\nthey put the light under a bushel. While they in truth speculate only\nconcerning themselves, only in the interest of their own instinct of\nself-preservation; they yet will not allow that they are splitting\ntheir brains only about themselves; they speculate under the delusion\nthat they are searching out the mysteries of another being. Pantheism\nidentifies man with Nature, whether with its visible appearance, or its\nabstract essence. Personalism isolates, separates, him from Nature;\nconverts him from a part into the whole, into an absolute essence by\nhimself. This is the distinction. If, therefore, you would be clear\non these subjects, exchange your mystical, perverted anthropology,\nwhich you call theology, for real anthropology, and speculate in\nthe light of consciousness and Nature concerning the difference\nor identity of the human essence with the essence of Nature. You\nyourselves admit that the essence of the pantheistical God is nothing\nbut the essence of Nature. Why, then, will you only see the mote in\nthe eyes of your opponents, and not observe the very obvious beam\nin your own eyes? why make yourselves an exception to a universally\nvalid law? Admit that your personal God is nothing else than your own\npersonal nature, that while you believe in and construct your supra-\nand extra-natural God, you believe in and construct nothing else than\nthe supra- and extra-naturalism of your own self.", "location": 263375}

{"paragraph": "The unwedded and ascetic life is the direct way to the heavenly,\nimmortal life, for heaven is nothing else than life liberated from\nthe conditions of the species, supernatural, sexless, absolutely\nsubjective life. The belief in personal immortality has at its\nfoundation the belief that difference of sex is only an external\nadjunct of individuality, that in himself the individual is a sexless,\nindependently complete, absolute being. But he who belongs to no sex\nbelongs to no species; sex is the cord which connects the individuality\nwith the species, and he who belongs to no species, belongs only to\nhimself, is an altogether independent, divine, absolute being. Hence\nonly when the species vanishes from the consciousness is the heavenly\nlife a certainty. He who lives in the consciousness of the species,\nand consequently of its reality, lives also in the consciousness of\nthe reality of sex. He does not regard it as a mechanically inserted,\nadventitious stone of stumbling, but as an inherent quality, a chemical\nconstituent of his being. He indeed recognises himself as a man in\nthe broader sense, but he is at the same time conscious of being\nrigorously determined by the sexual distinction, which penetrates not\nonly bones and marrow, but also his inmost self, the essential mode\nof his thought, will, and sensation. He therefore who lives in the\nconsciousness of the species, who limits and determines his feelings\nand imagination by the contemplation of real life, of real man, can\nconceive no life in which the life of the species, and therewith the\ndistinction of sex, is abolished; he regards the sexless individual,\nthe heavenly spirit, as an agreeable figment of the imagination.", "location": 390978}
{"paragraph": "But marriage--we mean, of course, marriage as the free bond of love\n[224]--is sacred in itself, by the very nature of the union which is\ntherein effected. That alone is a religious marriage, which is a true\nmarriage, which corresponds to the essence of marriage--of love. And\nso it is with all moral relations. Then only are they moral,--then\nonly are they enjoyed in a moral spirit, when they are regarded as\nsacred in themselves. True friendship exists only when the boundaries\nof friendship are preserved with religious conscientiousness, with\nthe same conscientiousness with which the believer watches over the\ndignity of his God.

{"paragraph": "What suggests to man the notion that miracle is conceivable is\nthat miracle is represented as an event perceptible by the senses,\nand hence man cheats his reason by material images which screen the\ncontradiction. The miracle of the turning of water into wine, for\nexample, implies in fact nothing else than that water is wine,--nothing\nelse than that two absolutely contradictory predicates or subjects\nare identical; for in the hand of the miracle-worker there is no\ndistinction between the two substances; the transformation is only\nthe visible appearance of this identity of two contradictories. But\nthe transformation conceals the contradiction, because the natural\nconception of change is interposed. Here, however, is no gradual, no\nnatural, or, so to speak, organic change; but an absolute, immaterial\none; a pure creatio ex nihilo. In the mysterious and momentous act of\nmiraculous power, in the act which constitutes the miracle, water is\nsuddenly and imperceptibly wine: which is equivalent to saying that\niron is wood, or wooden iron.", "location": 312425}
{"paragraph": "God is a threefold being, a trinity of persons, means: God is not\nonly a metaphysical, abstract, spiritual, but a physical being. The\ncentral point of the Trinity is the Son, for the Father is Father only\nthrough the Son; but the mystery of the generation of the Son is the\nmystery of physical nature. The Son is the need of sensuousness,\nor of the heart, satisfied in God; for all wishes of the heart,\neven the wish for a personal God and for heavenly felicity,\nare sensuous wishes;--the heart is essentially materialistic, it\ncontents itself only with an object which is seen and felt. This is\nespecially evident in the conception that the Son, even in the midst\nof the Divine Trinity, has the human body as an essential, permanent\nattribute. Ambrosius: \"Scriptum est Ephes. i.: Secundum carnem igitur\nomnia ipsi subjecta traduntur.\" Chrysostomus: \"Christum secundum carnem\npater jussit a cunctis angelis adorari.\" Theodoretus: \"Corpus Dominicum\nsurrexit quidem a mortuis, divina glorificata gloria ... corpus\ntamen est et habet, quam prius habuit, circumscriptionem.\" (See\nConcordienbuchs-anhang. \"Zeugnisse der h.

Faith destitute of\nlove, or indifferent to love, contradicts the reason, the natural sense\nof right in man, moral feeling, on which love immediately urges itself\nas a law. Hence faith, in contradiction with its intrinsic character,\nhas limits imposed on it by morality: a faith which effects nothing\ngood, which does not attest itself by love, comes to be held as not a\ntrue and living faith. But this limitation does not arise out of faith\nitself. It is the power of love, a power independent of faith, which\ngives laws to it; for moral character is here made the criterion of\nthe genuineness of faith, the truth of faith is made dependent on the\ntruth of ethics:--a relation which, however, is subversive of faith.", "location": 582627}

A\ndivine impulse this--a divine power, the power of words. The word is\nthe imaged, revealed, radiating, lustrous, enlightening thought. The\nword is the light of the world.

{"paragraph": "Now, when it is shown that what the subject is lies entirely in\nthe attributes of the subject; that is, that the predicate is the\ntrue subject; it is also proved that if the divine predicates are\nattributes of the human nature, the subject of those predicates is also\nof the human nature. But the divine predicates are partly general,\npartly personal. The general predicates are the metaphysical, but\nthese serve only as external points of support to religion; they are\nnot the characteristic definitions of religion. It is the personal\npredicates alone which constitute the essence of religion--in which\nthe Divine Being is the object of religion. Such are, for example,\nthat God is a Person, that he is the moral Lawgiver, the Father\nof mankind, the Holy One, the Just, the Good, the Merciful. It is,\nhowever, at once clear, or it will at least be clear in the sequel,\nwith regard to these and other definitions, that, especially as\napplied to a personality, they are purely human definitions, and that\nconsequently man in religion--in his relation to God--is in relation\nto his own nature; for to the religious sentiment these predicates\nare not mere conceptions, mere images, which man forms of God,\nto be distinguished from that which God is in himself, but truths,\nfacts, realities. Religion knows nothing of anthropomorphisms; to it\nthey are not anthropomorphisms. It is the very essence of religion,\nthat to it these definitions express the nature of God. They are\npronounced to be images only by the understanding, which reflects on\nreligion, and which while defending them yet before its own tribunal\ndenies them. But to the religious sentiment God is a real Father,\nreal Love and Mercy; for to it he is a real, living, personal being,\nand therefore his attributes are also living and personal. Nay, the\ndefinitions which are the most sufficing to the religious sentiment\nare precisely those which give the most offence to the understanding,\nand which in the process of reflection on religion it denies.

{"paragraph": "The unworldly, supernatural life is essentially also an unmarried\nlife. The celibate lies already, though not in the form of a law,\nin the inmost nature of Christianity. This is sufficiently declared\nin the supernatural origin of the Saviour,--a doctrine in which\nunspotted virginity is hallowed as the saving principle, as the\nprinciple of the new, the Christian world. Let not such passages as,\n\"Be fruitful and multiply,\" or, \"What God has joined together let\nnot man put asunder,\" be urged as a sanction of marriage. The first\npassage relates, as Tertullian and Jerome have already observed,\nonly to the unpeopled earth, not to the earth when filled with men,\nonly to the beginning, not to the end of the world, an end which\nwas initiated by the immediate appearance of God upon earth. And\nthe second also refers only to marriage as an institution of the Old\nTestament. Certain Jews proposed the question whether it were lawful\nfor a man to separate from his wife; and the most appropriate way of\ndealing with this question was the answer above cited. He who has once\nconcluded a marriage ought to hold it sacred. Marriage is intrinsically\nan indulgence to the weakness or rather the strength of the flesh,\nan evil which therefore must be restricted as much as possible. The\nindissolubleness of marriage is a nimbus, a sacred irradiance, which\nexpresses precisely the opposite of what minds, dazzled and perturbed\nby its lustre, seek beneath it. Marriage in itself is, in the sense\nof perfected Christianity, a sin, [132] or rather a weakness which\nis permitted and forgiven thee only on condition that thou for ever\nlimitest thyself to a single wife. In short, marriage is hallowed\nonly in the Old Testament, but not in the New. The New Testament\nknows a higher, a supernatural principle, the mystery of unspotted\nvirginity. [133] \"He who can receive it let him receive it.\" \"The\nchildren of this world marry, and are given in marriage: but they which\nshall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection\nfrom the dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage: neither can\nthey die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the\nchildren of God, being the children of the resurrection.\" Thus in\nheaven there is no marriage; the principle of sexual love is excluded\nfrom heaven as an earthly, worldly principle. But the heavenly life is\nthe true, perfected, eternal life of the Christian. Why then should\nI, who am destined for heaven, form a tie which is unloosed in my\ntrue destination? Why should I, who am potentially a heavenly being,\nnot realise this possibility even here? [134] Marriage is already\nproscribed from my mind, my heart, since it is expelled from heaven,\nthe essential object of my faith, hope, and life. How can an earthly\nwife have a place in my heaven-filled heart? How can I divide my\nheart between God and man? [135] The Christian's love to God is not\nan abstract or general love such as the love of truth, of justice, of\nscience; it is a love to a subjective, personal God, and is therefore\na subjective, personal love. It is an essential attribute of this love\nthat it is an exclusive, jealous love, for its object is a personal\nand at the same time the highest being, to whom no other can be\ncompared. \"Keep close to Jesus [Jesus Christ is the Christian's God],\nin life and in death; trust his faithfulness: he alone can help thee,\nwhen all else leaves thee. Thy beloved has this quality, that he will\nsuffer no rival; he alone will have thy heart, will rule alone in\nthy soul as a king on his throne.\"--\"What can the world profit thee\nwithout Jesus? To be without Christ is the pain of hell; to be with\nChrist, heavenly sweetness.\"--\"Thou canst not live without a friend:\nbut if the friendship of Christ is not more than all else to thee,\nthou wilt be beyond measure sad and disconsolate.\"--\"Love everything\nfor Jesus' sake, but Jesus for his own sake. Jesus Christ alone is\nworthy to be loved.\"--\"My God, my love [my heart]: thou art wholly\nmine, and I am wholly thine.\"--\"Love hopes and trusts ever in God,\neven when God is not gracious to it [or tastes bitter, non sapit];\nfor we cannot live in love without sorrow.... For the sake of the\nbeloved, the loving one must accept all things, even the hard and\nbitter.\"--\"My God and my all, ... in thy presence everything is\nsweet to me, in thy absence everything is distasteful.... Without\nthee nothing can please me.\"--\"Oh, when at last will that blessed,\nlonged-for hour appear, when thou wilt satisfy me wholly, and be\nall in all to me? So long as this is not granted me, my joy is only\nfragmentary.\"--\"When was it well with me without thee? or when was\nit ill with me in thy presence? I will rather be poor for thy sake,\nthan rich without thee. I will rather be a pilgrim on earth with thee,\nthan the possessor of heaven without thee. Where thou art is heaven;\ndeath and hell where thou art not. I long only for thee.\"--\"Thou\ncanst not serve God and at the same time have thy joys in earthly\nthings: thou must wean thyself from all acquaintances and friends,\nand sever thy soul from all temporal consolation. Believers in\nChrist should regard themselves, according to the admonition of the\nApostle Peter, only as strangers and pilgrims on the earth.\" [136]\nThus love to God as a personal being is a literal, strict, personal,\nexclusive love. How then can I at once love God and a mortal wife? Do\nI not thereby place God on the same footing with my wife? No! to a\nsoul which truly loves God, the love of woman is an impossibility,\nis adultery. \"He that is unmarried,\" says the Apostle Paul, \"careth\nfor the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord;\nbut he that is married careth for the things that are of the world,\nhow he may please his wife.\"", "location": 382108}

{"paragraph": "The difference between the belief of the Christians and that of\nthe heathen philosophers as to the destruction of the world is not\nto be overlooked. The Christian destruction of the world is only\na crisis of faith,--the separation of the Christian from all that\nis anti-christian, the triumph of faith over the world, a judgment\nof God, an anti-cosmical, supernaturalistic act. \"But the heavens\nand the earth which are now, by the same word are kept in store,\nreserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of\nungodly men.\"--2 Pet. iii. 7. The heathen destruction of the world is\na crisis of the cosmos itself, a process which takes place according\nto law, which is founded in the constitution of Nature. \"Sic origo\nmundi, non minus solem et lunam et vices siderum et animalium ortus,\nquam quibus mutarentur terrena, continuit. In his fuit inundatio,\nquae non secus quam hiems, quam aestas, lege mundi venit.\"--Seneca\n(Nat. Qu. l. iii. c. 29). It is the principle of life immanent in the\nworld, the essence of the world itself, which evolves this crisis\nout of itself. \"Aqua et ignis terrenis dominantur. Ex his ortus et\nex his interitus est.\"--(Ibid. c. 28.) \"Quidquid est, non erit; nec\nperibit, sed resolvetur.\"--(Idem. Epist. 71.) The Christians excluded\nthemselves from the destruction of the world. \"And he shall send\nhis angels with a great sound of a trumpet; and they shall gather\ntogether his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to\nthe other.\"--Matt. xxiv. 31. \"But there shall not a hair of your head\nperish.... And then shall they see the Son of Man coming in a cloud\nwith power and great glory. And when these things begin to come to\npass, then look up and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth\nnigh.\"--Luke xxi. 18, 27, 28. \"Watch ye therefore and pray always, that\nye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come\nto pass, and to stand before the Son of Man.\"--Ib. 36. The heathens,\non the contrary, identified their fate with the fate of the world. \"Hoc\nuniversum, quod omnia divina humanaque complectitur ... dies aliquis\ndissipabit et in confusionem veterem tenebrasque demerget. Eat\nnunc aliquis et singulas comploret animas. Quis tam superbae\nimpotentisque arrogantiae est, ut in hac naturae necessitate, omnia\nad eundem finem revocantis, se unum ac suos seponi velit.\"--Seneca\n(Cons. ad Polyb. cc. 20, 21). \"Ergo quandoque erit terminus rebus\nhumanis.... Non muri quenquam, non turres tuebuntur. Non proderunt\ntempla supplicibus.\"--(Nat. Qu. L. iii. c. 29.) Thus here we have again\nthe characteristic distinction between heathenism and Christianity. The\nheathen forgot himself in the world, the Christian forgot the world\nin himself. And as the heathen identified his destruction with the\ndestruction of the world, so he identified his immortality with\nthe immortality of the world. To the heathen, man was a common,\nto the Christian, a select being; to the latter immortality was a\nprivilege of man, to the former a common good which he vindicated\nto himself only because, and in so far as, he assigned to other\nbeings a share in it also. The Christians expected the destruction\nof the world immediately, because the Christian religion has in it\nno cosmical principle of development:--all which developed itself in\nChristendom developed itself only in contradiction with the original\nnature of Christianity;--because by the existence of God in the flesh,\ni.e., by the immediate identity of the species with the individual,\neverything was attained, the thread of history was cut short, no\nother thought of the future remained than the thought of a repetition\nof the second coming of the Lord. The heathens, on the contrary,\nplaced the destruction of the world in the distant future, because,\nliving in the contemplation of the universe, they did not set heaven\nand earth in motion on their own account,--because they extended and\nfreed their self-consciousness by the consciousness of the species,\nplaced immortality only in the perpetuation of the species, and thus\ndid not reserve the future to themselves, but left it to the coming\ngenerations. \"Veniet tempus quo posteri nostri tam aperta nos nescisse\nmirentur.\"--Seneca (Nat. Qu. l. vii. c. 25). He who places immortality\nin himself abolishes the principle of historical development. The\nChristians did indeed, according to Peter, expect a new heaven and\na new earth. But with this Christian, i.e., superterrestrial earth,\nthe theatre of history is for ever closed, the end of the actual\nworld is come. The heathens, on the contrary, set no limits to the\ndevelopment of the cosmos; they supposed the world to be destroyed\nonly to arise again renovated as a real world; they granted it eternal\nlife.

The pleasures of this\nearth are only medicines, says the same writer; true health exists only\nin immortal life--\"vera sanitas, nisi quando vera immortalitas.\" The\nheavenly life, the heavenly body, is as free and unlimited as\nwishes, as omnipotent as imagination. \"Futurae ergo resurrectionis\ncorpus imperfectae felicitatis erit, si cibos sumere non potuerit,\nimperfectae felicitatis, si cibus eguerit.\"--Augustin. (Epist. 102,\n\u00a7 6, edit. cit). Nevertheless, existence in a body without fatigue,\nwithout heaviness, without disagreeables, without disease, without\nmortality, is associated with the highest corporeal well-being. Even\nthe knowledge of God in heaven is free from any effort of thought or\nfaith, is sensational, immediate knowledge--intuition. The Christians\nare indeed not agreed whether God, as God, the essentia Dei, will\nbe visible to bodily eyes. (See, for example, Augustin. Serm. ad\nPop. p. 277, and Buddeus, Comp. Inst. Th. l. ii. c. 3, \u00a7 4.) But\nin this difference we again have only the contradiction between the\nabstract and the real God; the former is certainly not an object of\nvision, but the latter is so. \"Flesh and blood is the wall between\nme and Christ, which will be torn away.... There everything will\nbe certain. For in that life the eyes will see, the mouth taste,\nand the nose smell it; the treasure will shine into the soul and\nlife.... Faith will cease, and I shall behold with my eyes.\"--Luther\n(Th. ix. p. 595). It is clear from this again, that God, as he is\nan object of religious sentiment, is nothing else than a product\nof the imagination. The heavenly beings are supersensuous sensuous,\nimmaterial material beings, i.e., beings of the imagination; but they\nare like God, nay, identical with God, consequently God also is a\nsupersensuous sensuous, an immaterial material being.", "location": 729736}

{"paragraph": "THE OMNIPOTENCE OF FEELING, OR THE MYSTERY OF PRAYER.", "location": 289449}
{"paragraph": "The essential act of religion, that in which religion puts into\naction what we have designated as its essence, is prayer. Prayer\nis all-powerful. What the pious soul entreats for in prayer God\nfulfils. But he prays not for spiritual gifts [157] alone, which\nlie in some sort in the power of man; he prays also for things which\nlie out of him, which are in the power of Nature, a power which it\nis the very object of prayer to overcome; in prayer he lays hold\non a supernatural means, in order to attain ends in themselves\nnatural. God is to him not the causa remota but the causa proxima,\nthe immediate, efficient cause of all natural effects. All so-called\nsecondary forces and second causes are nothing to him when he prays;\nif they were anything to him, the might, the fervour of prayer would\nbe annihilated. But in fact they have no existence for him; otherwise\nhe would assuredly seek to attain his end only by some intermediate\nprocess. But he desires immediate help. He has recourse to prayer in\nthe certainty that he can do more, infinitely more, by prayer, than\nby all the efforts of reason and all the agencies of Nature,--in\nthe conviction that prayer possesses superhuman and supernatural\npowers. [158] But in prayer he applies immediately to God. Thus God\nis to him the immediate cause, the fulfilment of prayer, the power\nwhich realises prayer. But an immediate act of God is a miracle;\nhence miracle is essential to the religious view. Religion explains\neverything miraculously. That miracles do not always happen is indeed\nobvious, as that man does not always pray. But the consideration that\nmiracles do not always happen lies outside the nature of religion, in\nthe empirical or physical mode of view only. Where religion begins,\nthere also begins miracle. Every true prayer is a miracle, an act\nof the wonder-working power. External miracles themselves only make\nvisible internal miracles, that is, they are only a manifestation in\ntime and space, and therefore as a special fact, of what in and by\nitself is a fundamental position of religion, namely, that God is,\nin general, the supernatural, immediate cause of all things. The\nmiracle of fact is only an impassioned expression of religion, a\nmoment of inspiration. Miracles happen only in extraordinary crises,\nin which there is an exaltation of the feelings: hence there are\nmiracles of anger. No miracle is wrought in cold blood. But it\nis precisely in moments of passion that the latent nature reveals\nitself. Man does not always pray with equal warmth and power. Such\nprayers are therefore ineffective. Only ardent prayer reveals the\nnature of prayer. Man truly prays when he regards prayer as in itself\na sacred power, a divine force. So it is with miracles. Miracles\nhappen--no matter whether few or many--wherever there is, as a basis\nfor them, a belief in the miraculous. But the belief in miracle\nis no theoretic or objective mode of viewing the world and Nature;\nmiracle realises practical wants, and that in contradiction with the\nlaws which are imperative to the reason; in miracle man subjugates\nNature, as in itself a nullity, to his own ends, which he regards\nas a reality; miracle is the superlative expression of spiritual or\nreligious utilitarianism; in miracle all things are at the service\nof necessitous man. It is clear from this, that the conception of\nthe world which is essential to religion is that of the practical\nor subjective standpoint, that God--for the miracle-working power\nis identical with God--is a purely practical or subjective Being,\nserving, however, as a substitute for a theoretic view, and is thus\nno object of thought, of the knowing faculty, any more than miracle,\nwhich owes its origin to the negation of thought. If I place myself\nin the point of view of thought, of investigation, of theory, in\nwhich I consider things in themselves, in their mutual relations,\nthe miracle-working being vanishes into nothing, miracle disappears;\ni.e., the religious miracle, which is absolutely different from the\nnatural miracle, though they are continually interchanged, in order\nto stultify reason, and, under the appearance of natural science, to\nintroduce religious miracle into the sphere of rationality and reality.", "location": 441339}

{"paragraph": "In Christianity the moral laws are regarded as the commandments\nof God; morality is even made the criterion of piety; but ethics\nhave nevertheless a subordinate rank, they have not in themselves a\nreligious significance. This belongs only to faith. Above morality\nhovers God, as a being distinct from man, a being to whom the\nbest is due, while the remnants only fall to the share of man. All\nthose dispositions which ought to be devoted to life, to man--all\nthe best powers of humanity, are lavished on the being who wants\nnothing. The real cause is converted into an impersonal means, a\nmerely conceptional, imaginary cause usurps the place of the true\none. Man thanks God for those benefits which have been rendered to\nhim even at the cost of sacrifice by his fellow-man. The gratitude\nwhich he expresses to his benefactor is only ostensible; it is\npaid, not to him, but to God. He is thankful, grateful to God,\nbut unthankful to man. [225] Thus is the moral sentiment subverted\ninto religion! Thus does man sacrifice man to God! The bloody human\nsacrifice is in fact only a rude, material expression of the inmost\nsecret of religion. Where bloody human sacrifices are offered to God,\nsuch sacrifices are regarded as the highest thing, physical existence\nas the chief good. For this reason life is sacrificed to God, and it\nis so on extraordinary occasions; the supposition being that this is\nthe way to show him the greatest honour. If Christianity no longer, at\nleast in our day, offers bloody sacrifices to its God, this arises, to\nsay nothing of other reasons, from the fact that physical existence is\nno longer regarded as the highest good. Hence the soul, the emotions\nare now offered to God, because these are held to be something\nhigher. But the common case is, that in religion man sacrifices some\nduty towards man--such as that of respecting the life of his fellow,\nof being grateful to him--to a religious obligation,--sacrifices\nhis relation to man to his relation to God. The Christians, by\nthe idea that God is without wants, and that he is only an object\nof pure adoration, have certainly done away with many pernicious\nconceptions. But this freedom from wants is only a metaphysical idea,\nwhich is by no means part of the peculiar nature of religion. When\nthe need for worship is supposed to exist only on one side, the\nsubjective side, this has the invariable effect of one-sidedness,\nand leaves the religious emotions cold; hence, if not in express\nwords, yet in fact, there must be attributed to God a condition\ncorresponding to the subjective need, the need of the worshipper, in\norder to establish reciprocity. [226] All the positive definitions\nof religion are based on reciprocity. The religious man thinks of\nGod because God thinks of him; he loves God because God has first\nloved him. God is jealous of man; religion is jealous of morality;\n[227] it sucks away the best forces of morality; it renders to man\nonly the things that are man's, but to God the things that are God's;\nand to him is rendered true, living emotion,--the heart.", "location": 603930}

As the flute has another\nsound to me than the trumpet, and I cannot confound the impressions\nproduced by the former with the impressions produced by the latter;\nso I could not transfer to a natural or human being the emotions of\nreligion, if the object of religion, God, were specifically different\nfrom the natural or human being, and consequently the impressions\nwhich he produced on me were specific, peculiar.", "location": 619780}

{"paragraph": "The essential standpoint of religion is the practical or\nsubjective. The end of religion is the welfare, the salvation, the\nultimate felicity of man; the relation of man to God is nothing else\nthan his relation to his own spiritual good; God is the realised\nsalvation of the soul, or the unlimited power of effecting the\nsalvation, the bliss of man. [150] The Christian religion is specially\ndistinguished from other religions in this,--that no other has given\nequal prominence to the salvation of man. But this salvation is not\ntemporal earthly prosperity and well-being. On the contrary, the most\ngenuine Christians have declared that earthly good draws man away from\nGod, whereas adversity, suffering, afflictions lead him back to God,\nand hence are alone suited to Christians. Why? Because in trouble\nman is only practically or subjectively disposed; in trouble he has\nresource only to the one thing needful; in trouble God is felt to be a\nwant of man. Pleasure, joy, expands man; trouble, suffering, contracts\nand concentrates him; in suffering man denies the reality of the world;\nthe things that charm the imagination of the artist and the intellect\nof the thinker lose their attraction for him, their power over him; he\nis absorbed in himself, in his own soul. The soul thus self-absorbed,\nself-concentrated, seeking satisfaction in itself alone, denying the\nworld, idealistic in relation to the world, to Nature in general,\nbut realistic in relation to man, caring only for its inherent need\nof salvation,--this soul is God.

{"paragraph": "God is love. This is the sublimest dictum of Christianity. But\nthe contradiction of faith and love is contained in the very\nproposition. Love is only a predicate, God the subject. What, then,\nis this subject in distinction from love? And I must necessarily ask\nthis question, make this distinction. The necessity of the distinction\nwould be done away with only if it were said conversely: Love is\nGod, love is the absolute being. Thus love would take the position\nof the substance. In the proposition \"God is love,\" the subject is\nthe darkness in which faith shrouds itself; the predicate is the\nlight, which first illuminates the intrinsically dark subject. In\nthe predicate I affirm love, in the subject faith. Love does not\nalone fill my soul: I leave a place open for my uncharitableness by\nthinking of God as a subject in distinction from the predicate. It is\ntherefore inevitable that at one moment I lose the thought of love,\nat another the thought of God, that at one moment I sacrifice the\npersonality of God to the divinity of love, at another the divinity of\nlove to the personality of God. The history of Christianity has given\nsufficient proof of this contradiction. Catholicism, especially, has\ncelebrated Love as the essential deity with so much enthusiasm, that\nto it the personality of God has been entirely lost in this love. But\nat the same time it has sacrificed love to the majesty of faith. Faith\nclings to the self-subsistence of God; love does away with it. \"God\nis love,\" means, God is nothing by himself: he who loves, gives up\nhis egoistical independence; he makes what he loves indispensable,\nessential to his existence. But while Self is being sunk in the\ndepths of love, the idea of the Person rises up again and disturbs\nthe harmony of the divine and human nature which had been established\nby love. Faith advances with its pretensions, and allows only just so\nmuch to Love as belongs to a predicate in the ordinary sense. It does\nnot permit love freely to unfold itself; it makes love the abstract,\nand itself the concrete, the fact, the basis.

It is true that Protestantism also commands the\nmortifying of the flesh, the negation of the natural man; but apart\nfrom the fact that this negation has for Protestantism no religious\nsignificance and efficacy, does not justify, i.e., make acceptable\nto God, procure salvation; the negation of the flesh in Protestantism\nis not distinguished from that limitation of the flesh which natural\nreason and morality enjoin on man. The necessary practical consequences\nof the Christian faith Protestantism has relegated to the other world,\nto heaven--in other words, has denied them. la heaven first ceases\nthe worldly standpoint of Protestantism; there we no longer marry,\nthere first we are new creatures; but here everything remains as of old\n\"until that life; there the external life will be changed, for Christ\ndid not come to change the creature.\"--Luther (Th. xv. p. 62). Here\nwe are half heathens, half Christians; half citizens of the earth,\nhalf citizens of heaven. Of this division, this disunity, this chasm,\nCatholicism knows nothing. What it denies in heaven, i.e., in faith, it\ndenies, also, as far as possible, on earth, i.e., in morality. \"Grandis\nigitur virtutis est et sollicitate diligentiae, superare quod nata sis:\nin carne non carnaliter vivere, tecum pugnare quotidie.\"--Hieronymus\n(Ep.

On\nthis ground it is true that for a definite positive religion--that\nis, relatively--the certainty of the existence of God is immediate;\nfor just as involuntarily, as necessarily, as the Greek was a Greek,\nso necessarily were his gods Greek beings, so necessarily were they\nreal, existent beings. Religion is that conception of the nature of the\nworld and of man which is essential to, i.e., identical with, a man's\nnature. But man does not stand above this his necessary conception;\non the contrary, it stands above him; it animates, determines, governs\nhim. The necessity of a proof, of a middle term to unite qualities\nwith existence, the possibility of a doubt, is abolished. Only that\nwhich is apart from my own being is capable of being doubted by\nme. How then can I doubt of God, who is my being? To doubt of God\nis to doubt of myself. Only when God is thought of abstractly, when\nhis predicates are the result of philosophic abstraction, arises the\ndistinction or separation between subject and predicate, existence\nand nature--arises the fiction that the existence or the subject is\nsomething else than the predicate, something immediate, indubitable,\nin distinction from the predicate, which is held to be doubtful. But\nthis is only a fiction. A God who has abstract predicates has also\nan abstract existence. Existence, being, varies with varying qualities.", "location": 75679}

Where life is\nnot in contradiction with a feeling, an imagination, an idea, and where\nthis feeling, this idea, is not held authoritative and absolute, the\nbelief in another and a heavenly life does not arise. The future life\nis nothing else than life in unison with the feeling, with the idea,\nwhich the present life contradicts. The whole import of the future\nlife is the abolition of this discordance, and the realisation of a\nstate which corresponds to the feelings, in which man is in unison\nwith himself. An unknown, unimagined future is a ridiculous chimera:\nthe other world is nothing more than the reality of a known idea,\nthe satisfaction of a conscious desire, the fulfilment of a wish;\n[144] it is only the removal of limits which here oppose themselves\nto the realisation of the idea.

No! from yonder world there streams upon me with the splendour\nof virgin gold what here shines only with the dimness of unrefined\nore. The future world has no other significance, no other basis of\nits existence, than the separation of the metal from the admixture\nof foreign elements, the separation of the good from the bad,\nof the pleasant from the unpleasant, of the praiseworthy from the\nblamable. The future world is the bridal in which man concludes\nhis union with his beloved. Long has he loved his bride, long has\nhe yearned after her; but external relations, hard reality, have\nstood in the way of his union to her. When the wedding takes place,\nhis beloved one does not become a different being; else how could he\nso ardently long for her? She only becomes his own; from an object\nof yearning and affectionate desire she becomes an object of actual\npossession. It is true that here below, the other world is only an\nimage, a conception; still it is not the image of a remote, unknown\nthing, but a portrait of that which man loves and prefers before all\nelse.

It is true that I have always taken as the standard of the mode\nof teaching and writing, not the abstract, particular, professional\nphilosopher, but universal man, that I have regarded man as the\ncriterion of truth, and not this or that founder of a system, and\nhave from the first placed the highest excellence of the philosopher\nin this, that he abstains, both as a man and as an author, from the\nostentation of philosophy, i.e., that he is a philosopher only in\nreality, not formally, that he is a quiet philosopher, not a loud\nand still less a brawling one. Hence, in all my works, as well as\nin the present one, I have made the utmost clearness, simplicity,\nand definiteness a law to myself, so that they may be understood,\nat least in the main, by every cultivated and thinking man. But\nnotwithstanding this, my work can be appreciated and fully understood\nonly by the scholar, that is to say, by the scholar who loves truth,\nwho is capable of forming a judgment, who is above the notions\nand prejudices of the learned and unlearned vulgar; for although a\nthoroughly independent production, it has yet its necessary logical\nbasis in history. I very frequently refer to this or that historical\nphenomenon without expressly designating it, thinking this superfluous;\nand such references can be understood by the scholar alone. Thus,\nfor example, in the very first chapter, where I develop the necessary\nconsequences of the standpoint of Feeling, I allude to Jacobi and\nSchleiermacher; in the second chapter I allude chiefly to Kantism,\nScepticism, Theism, Materialism and Pantheism; in the chapter on the\n\"Standpoint of Religion,\" where I discuss the contradictions between\nthe religious or theological and the physical or natural-philosophical\nview of Nature, I refer to philosophy in the age of orthodoxy, and\nespecially to the philosophy of Descartes and Leibnitz, in which\nthis contradiction presents itself in a peculiarly characteristic\nmanner. The reader, therefore, who is unacquainted with the historical\nfacts and ideas presupposed in my work, will fail to perceive on what\nmy arguments and ideas hinge; no wonder if my positions often appear\nto him baseless, however firm the footing on which they stand. It\nis true that the subject of my work is of universal human interest;\nmoreover, its fundamental ideas, though not in the form in which they\nare here expressed, or in which they could be expressed under existing\ncircumstances, will one day become the common property of mankind:\nfor nothing is opposed to them in the present day but empty, powerless\nillusions and prejudices in contradiction with the true nature of\nman. But in considering this subject in the first instance, I was under\nthe necessity of treating it as a matter of science, of philosophy; and\nin rectifying the aberrations of Religion, Theology, and Speculation,\nI was naturally obliged to use their expressions, and even to appear\nto speculate, or--which is the same thing--to turn theologian myself,\nwhile I nevertheless only analyse speculation, i.e., reduce theology\nto anthropology. My work, as I said before, contains, and applies in\nthe concrete, the principle of a new philosophy suited--not to the\nschools, but--to man. Yes, it contains that principle, but only by\nevolving it out of the very core of religion; hence, be it said in\npassing, the new philosophy can no longer, like the old Catholic and\nmodern Protestant scholasticism, fall into the temptation to prove\nits agreement with religion by its agreement with Christian dogmas;\non the contrary, being evolved from the nature of religion, it has\nin itself the true essence of religion,--is, in its very quality as\na philosophy, a religion also.

Unity, unconditionality,\nfreedom from exceptions, immediate certitude, is alone the character of\ndivinity. A book that imposes on me the necessity of discrimination,\nthe necessity of criticism, in order to separate the divine from\nthe human, the permanent from the temporary, is no longer a divine,\ncertain, infallible book,--it is degraded to the rank of profane\nbooks; for every profane book has the same quality, that together\nwith or in the human it contains the divine, that is, together with\nor in the individual it contains the universal and eternal. But that\nonly is a truly divine book in which there is not merely something\ngood and something bad, something permanent and something temporary,\nbut in which all comes as it were from one crucible, all is eternal,\ntrue and good. What sort of a revelation is that in which I must\nfirst listen to the apostle Paul, then to Peter, then to James,\nthen to John, then to Matthew, then to Mark, then to Luke, until\nat last I come to a passage where my soul, athirst for God, can cry\nout: Eureka! here speaks the Holy Spirit himself! here is something\nfor me, something for all times and men.

The word is\nnot a matter of indifference in relation to the thought; a definite\nthought can only be rendered by a definite word. Another word, another\nletter--another sense. It is true that such faith is superstition;\nbut this superstition is alone the true, undisguised, open faith,\nwhich is not ashamed of its consequences. If God numbers the hairs\non the head of a man, if no sparrow falls to the ground without his\nwill, how could he leave to the stupidity and caprice of scribes his\nWord--that Word on which depends the everlasting salvation of man?

In another I\nfirst have the consciousness of humanity; through him I first learn,\nI first feel, that I am a man: in my love for him it is first clear to\nme that he belongs to me and I to him, that we two cannot be without\neach other, that only community constitutes humanity. But morally,\nalso, there is a qualitative, critical distinction between the I and\nthou. My fellow-man is my objective conscience; he makes my failings\na reproach to me; even when he does not expressly mention them, he\nis my personified feeling of shame. The consciousness of the moral\nlaw, of right, of propriety, of truth itself, is indissolubly united\nwith my consciousness of another than myself.

In short, there is a qualitative, critical\ndifference between men. But Christianity extinguishes this qualitative\ndistinction; it sets the same stamp on all men alike, and regards\nthem as one and the same individual, because it knows no distinction\nbetween the species and the individual: it has one and the same means\nof salvation for all men, it sees one and the same original sin in all.", "location": 368394}

In relation to God, it is said, these\npredicates are certainly without any objective validity; but to me,\nif he is to exist for me, he cannot appear otherwise than as he does\nappear to me, namely, as a being with attributes analogous to the\nhuman. But this distinction between what God is in himself, and what\nhe is for me destroys the peace of religion, and is besides in itself\nan unfounded and untenable distinction. I cannot know whether God is\nsomething else in himself or for himself than he is for me; what he is\nto me is to me all that he is. For me, there lies in these predicates\nunder which he exists for me, what he is in himself, his very nature;\nhe is for me what he can alone ever be for me. The religious man finds\nperfect satisfaction in that which God is in relation to himself;\nof any other relation he knows nothing, for God is to him what he can\nalone be to man. In the distinction above stated, man takes a point\nof view above himself, i.e., above his nature, the absolute measure\nof his being; but this transcendentalism is only an illusion; for I\ncan make the distinction between the object as it is in itself, and\nthe object as it is for me, only where an object can really appear\notherwise to me, not where it appears to me such as the absolute\nmeasure of my nature determines it to appear--such as it must appear\nto me.

The measure of the species is the absolute measure, law, and\ncriterion of man. And, indeed, religion has the conviction that its\nconceptions, its predicates of God, are such as every man ought to\nhave, and must have, if he would have the true ones--that they are\nthe conceptions necessary to human nature; nay, further, that they\nare objectively true, representing God as he is. To every religion\nthe gods of other religious are only notions concerning God, but its\nown conception of God is to it God himself, the true God--God such as\nhe is in himself. Religion is satisfied only with a complete Deity,\na God without reservation; it will not have a mere phantasm of God; it\ndemands God himself. Religion gives up its own existence when it gives\nup the nature of God; it is no longer a truth when it renounces the\npossession of the true God.

My knowledge, my will, is limited; but my limit\nis not the limit of another man, to say nothing of mankind; what is\ndifficult to me is easy to another; what is impossible, inconceivable,\nto one age, is to the coming age conceivable and possible. My life is\nbound to a limited time; not so the life of humanity. The history of\nmankind consists of nothing else than a continuous and progressive\nconquest of limits, which at a given time pass for the limits of\nhumanity, and therefore for absolute insurmountable limits. But\nthe future always unveils the fact that the alleged limits of the\nspecies were only limits of individuals. The most striking proofs\nof this are presented by the history of philosophy and of physical\nscience. It would be highly interesting and instructive to write a\nhistory of the sciences entirely from this point of view, in order to\nexhibit in all its vanity the presumptuous notion of the individual\nthat he can set limits to his race. Thus the species is unlimited;\nthe individual alone limited.", "location": 356277}

{"paragraph": "Faith does indeed make man happy; but thus much is certain: it infuses\ninto him no really moral dispositions. If it ameliorate man, if it\nhave moral dispositions as its consequence, this proceeds solely\nfrom the inward conviction of the irreversible reality of morals:--a\nconviction independent of religious faith. It is morality alone, and\nby no means faith, that cries out in the conscience of the believer:\nthy faith is nothing, if it does not make thee good. It is not to be\ndenied that the assurance of eternal salvation, the forgiveness of\nsins, the sense of favour and release from all punishment, inclines\nman to do good. The man who has this confidence possesses all things;\nhe is happy; [218] he becomes indifferent to the good things of\nthis world; no envy, no avarice, no ambition, no sensual desire, can\nenslave him; everything earthly vanishes in the prospect of heavenly\ngrace and eternal bliss. But in him good works do not proceed from\nessentially virtuous dispositions. It is not love, not the object\nof love, man, the basis of all morality, which is the motive of his\ngood works. No! he does good not for the sake of goodness itself,\nnot for the sake of man, but for the sake of God;--out of gratitude\nto God, who has done all for him, and for whom therefore he must on\nhis side do all that lies in his power. He forsakes sin, because it\nwounds God, his Saviour, his Benefactor. [219] The idea of virtue is\nhere the idea of compensatory sacrifice. God has sacrificed himself\nfor man; therefore man must sacrifice himself to God. The greater the\nsacrifice the better the deed. The more anything contradicts man and\nNature, the greater the abnegation, the greater is the virtue. This\nmerely negative idea of goodness has been especially realised and\ndeveloped by Catholicism. Its highest moral idea is that of sacrifice;\nhence the high significance attached to the denial of sexual love,--to\nvirginity. Chastity, or rather virginity, is the characteristic virtue\nof the Catholic faith,--for this reason, that it has no basis in\nNature. It is the most fanatical, transcendental, fantastical virtue,\nthe virtue of supranaturalistic faith;--to faith, the highest virtue,\nbut in itself no virtue at all. Thus faith makes that a virtue which\nintrinsically, substantially, is no virtue; it has therefore no sense\nof virtue; it must necessarily depreciate true virtue because it so\nexalts a merely apparent virtue, because it is guided by no idea but\nthat of the negation, the contradiction of human nature.", "location": 583732}
{"paragraph": "Faith is the highest to itself, because its object is a divine\npersonality. Hence it makes salvation dependent on itself, not on\nthe fulfilment of common human duties. But that which has eternal\nsalvation as its consequence, necessarily becomes in the mind of\nman the chief thing. As therefore inwardly morality is subordinate\nto faith, so it must also be outwardly, practically subordinate,\nnay, sacrificed, to faith. It is inevitable that there should be\nactions in which faith exhibits itself in distinction from morality,\nor rather in contradiction with it;--actions which are morally bad,\nbut which according to faith are laudable, because they have in view\nthe advantage of faith. All salvation depends on faith: it follows that\nall again depends on the salvation of faith. If faith is endangered,\neternal salvation and the honour of God are endangered. Hence\nfaith absolves from everything; for, strictly considered, it is the\nsole subjective good in man, as God is the sole good and positive\nbeing:--the highest commandment therefore is: Believe!

{"paragraph": "But feeling has here been adduced only as an example. It is\nthe same with every other power, faculty, potentiality, reality,\nactivity--the name is indifferent--which is defined as the essential\norgan of any object. Whatever is a subjective expression of a nature\nis simultaneously also its objective expression. Man cannot get\nbeyond his true nature. He may indeed by means of the imagination\nconceive individuals of another so-called higher kind, but he can\nnever get loose from his species, his nature; the conditions of\nbeing, the positive final predicates which he gives to these other\nindividuals, are always determinations or qualities drawn from his\nown nature--qualities in which he in truth only images and projects\nhimself. There may certainly be thinking beings besides men on the\nother planets of our solar system. But by the supposition of such\nbeings we do not change our standing point--we extend our conceptions\nquantitatively not qualitatively. For as surely as on the other planets\nthere are the same laws of motion, so surely are there the same laws of\nperception and thought as here. In fact, we people the other planets,\nnot that we may place there different beings from ourselves, but more\nbeings of our own or of a similar nature. [8]", "location": 57483}

Highly as the ancients estimated the intelligence, the\nreason, they were yet liberal and objective enough, theoretically as\nwell as practically, to allow that which they distinguished from mind,\nnamely, matter, to live, and even to live eternally; the Christians\nevinced their theoretical as well as practical intolerance in their\nbelief that they secured the eternity of their subjective life\nonly by annihilating, as in the doctrine of the destruction of the\nworld, the opposite of subjectivity--Nature. The ancients were free\nfrom themselves, but their freedom was that of indifference towards\nthemselves; the Christians were free from Nature, but their freedom\nwas not that of reason, not true freedom, which limits itself by\nthe contemplation of the world, by Nature,--it was the freedom of\nfeeling and imagination, the freedom of miracle. The ancients were so\nenraptured by the cosmos, that they lost sight of themselves, suffered\nthemselves to be merged in the whole; the Christians despised the\nworld;--what is the creature compared with the Creator? what are sun,\nmoon, and earth compared with the human soul? [119] The world passes\naway, but man, nay, the individual, personal man, is eternal. If the\nChristians severed man from all community with Nature, and hence fell\ninto the extreme of an arrogant fastidiousness, which stigmatised the\nremotest comparison of man with the brutes as an impious violation\nof human dignity; the heathens, on the other hand, fell into the\nopposite extreme, into that spirit of depreciation which abolishes\nthe distinction between man and the brute, or even, as was the case,\nfor example, with Celsus, the opponent of Christianity, degrades man\nbeneath the brute.", "location": 352042}

Augustinianism\nwould be a truth, and a truth opposed to Pelagianism, only if man\nhad the devil for his God, and, with the consciousness that he was\nthe devil, honoured, reverenced, and worshipped him as the highest\nbeing.
