"Title: Kant's Critique of Judgement"
"Author: Immanuel Kant"
{"sentence": "[56] [In the Preface to the _Metaphysical Elements of Ethics_, \u00a7 xvii., Kant gives the term _moral apathy_ to that freedom from the sway of the affections, which is distinguished from indifference to them.]", "location": 773809}
{"sentence": "A judgement of others which is unfavourable to ours may indeed rightly make us scrutinise our own with care, but it can never convince us of its incorrectness.", "location": 319626}
{"sentence": "As no extraneous charm must mingle with the satisfaction felt in a beautiful object, if the judgement about beauty is to remain pure; so in the case of the sublime we must not be afraid of the object which yet in certain aspects is fearful.", "location": 32842}
{"sentence": "_The condition of necessity which a judgement of taste asserts is the Idea of a common sense_  If judgements of taste (like cognitive judgements) had a definite objective principle, then the person who lays them down in accordance with this latter would claim an unconditioned necessity for his judgement.", "location": 211821}

{"sentence": "_Metaphysic of Morals_, Introd.", "location": 767112}
{"sentence": "_A priori principles_   Conformity to law.", "location": 137163}
{"sentence": "Only if he is conscious of an upright disposition pleasing to God do those operations of might serve to awaken in him the Idea of the sublimity of this Being, for then he recognises in himself a sublimity of disposition conformable to His will; and thus he is raised above the fear of such operations of nature, which he no longer regards as outbursts of His wrath.", "location": 272188}
{"sentence": "The student of the Critique of Pure Reason will remember how closely, in his Transcendental Logic, Kant follows the lines of the ordinary logic of the schools.", "location": 20152}
{"sentence": "By means of this distinction we can settle many disputes about beauty between judges of taste; by showing that the one is speaking of free, the other of dependent, beauty,--that the first is making a pure, the second an applied, judgement of taste.", "location": 199583}
{"sentence": "For I know that intuitions are given to the senses of men and are brought by the Understanding under a concept and thus under a rule; that this concept only contains the common characteristic (with omission of the particular ones) and is thus discursive; and that the rules for bringing given representations under a consciousness in general are given by Understanding before those intuitions, etc.", "location": 751927}
{"sentence": "The matter that disengages itself, which is dissipated suddenly at the moment of solidification, is a considerable quantum of caloric, the disappearance of which, as it was only required for preserving fluidity, leaves the new ice not in the least colder than the water which shortly before was fluid.", "location": 460437}
{"sentence": "It is not a work like that of a tradesman, the magnitude of which can be judged, exacted, or paid for, according to a definite standard; and again, though the mind is occupied, still it feels itself contented and stimulated, without looking to any other purpose (independently of reward.)", "location": 401332}
{"sentence": "But his effort is bounded; and from nature, although he may expect here and there a contingent accordance, he can never expect a regular harmony agreeing according to constant rules (such as his maxims are and must be, internally), with the purpose that he yet feels himself obliged and impelled to accomplish.", "location": 681881}
{"sentence": "The faculty of desire, so far as it is determinable only through concepts, _i.e._ to act in conformity with the representation of a purpose, would be the Will.", "location": 174362}
{"sentence": "Or if, instead of this Idealism of final causes, we wish to remain attached to the principle of the Realism of this particular kind of causality, we may set beneath natural purposes many intelligent original beings or only a single one.", "location": 655900}
{"sentence": "Finally, _Theism_ can just as little establish dogmatically the possibility of natural purposes as a key to Teleology; although it certainly is superior to all other grounds of explanation in that, through the Understanding which it ascribes to the original Being, it rescues in the best way the purposiveness of nature from Idealism, and introduces a causality acting with design for its production.", "location": 555191}
{"sentence": "But the fact that something infinitely better than all assumed manner, viz.", "location": 432374}
{"sentence": "[37] [This was a celebrated statue executed by Myron, a Greek sculptor, contemporary with Polycletus.", "location": 769972}
{"sentence": "(2) Those who not only maintain the _Realism_ of natural purposes, but also set about explaining it, believe that they can comprehend, at least as regards its possibility, a practical kind of causality, viz.", "location": 553826}
{"sentence": "In either reference the purposiveness of the given representation ought to be judged only in respect of this _faculty_ (without purpose or interest); but in the first case it is ascribed to the Object as a _mathematical_ determination of the Imagination, in the second as _dynamical_.", "location": 234005}
{"sentence": "For there belongs to the concept of an original Being, inasmuch as it is not derived from anything, the unconditioned necessity of its presence, and (in order to represent this) its complete determination by its [mere][155] concept.", "location": 731445}
{"sentence": "Wohlgefallen; _satisfaction_.", "location": 70408}
{"sentence": "Whether or not in the graded list of the professions we ought to count watchmakers as artists, but smiths only as handicraftsmen, would require another point of view from which to judge than that which we are here taking up; viz.", "location": 362845}
{"sentence": "a _purpose_ in respect of our Imagination.", "location": 457907}
{"sentence": "So [we saw that] the transcendental Judgement which contains the conditions of subsuming under categories was for itself not _nomothetic_, but that it only indicated the conditions of sensuous intuition, under which reality (application) can be supplied to a given concept, as law of the Understanding, whereby the Judgement could never fall into discord with itself (at least as far as its principles are concerned).", "location": 533487}
{"sentence": "If now we place under a concept a representation of the Imagination belonging to its presentation, but which occasions solely by itself more thought than can ever be comprehended in a definite concept, and which therefore enlarges aesthetically the concept itself in an unbounded fashion,--the Imagination is here creative, and it brings the faculty of intellectual Ideas (the Reason) into movement; _i.e._ a movement, occasioned by a representation, towards more thought (though belonging, no doubt, to the concept of the object) than can be grasped in the representation or made clear.", "location": 386623}
{"sentence": "Taste [merely][65] claims autonomy.", "location": 315884}
{"sentence": "But it is instructive to observe that neither on Kantian principles nor on any other can we _demonstrate_ this; to cross the chasm which separates one man\u2019s personality from another\u2019s requires a venture of faith just as emphatically as any theological formula.", "location": 48249}
{"sentence": "Thus the agreement of a representation with these conditions of the Judgement must be capable of being assumed as valid _a priori_ for every one.", "location": 332433}
{"sentence": "Now for the mathematical estimation of magnitude there is, indeed, no maximum (for the power of numbers extends to infinity); but for its aesthetical estimation there is always a maximum, and of this I say that if it is judged as the absolute measure than which no greater is possible subjectively (for the judging subject), it brings with it the Idea of the sublime and produces that emotion which no mathematical estimation of its magnitude by means of numbers can bring about (except so far as the aesthetical fundamental measure remains vividly in the Imagination).", "location": 242320}
{"sentence": "That is as much as to say that the determining ground of a judgement of taste may indeed be objective, but that it cannot be reduced to definite concepts, and that consequently about the judgement itself nothing can be _decided_ by proofs, although much may rightly be _contested_.", "location": 436330}
{"sentence": "This, as it appeals to something supersensible to which our insight does not extend, is not so easy to controvert; but that is because its concept of the original Being is not possible to understand.", "location": 548296}
{"sentence": "But no one could maintain that from this definition it follows that we are not compelled to postulate design in the mind of the artist who paints a beautiful picture.", "location": 38456}
{"sentence": "But the other [the feeling of the Sublime[43]] is a pleasure that arises only indirectly; viz.", "location": 227700}
{"sentence": "Although that concept may be transcendent for the speculative Reason, and the properties which we ascribe to the Being thereby thought may, objectively used, conceal an anthropomorphism in themselves; yet the design of its use is not to determine the nature of that Being which is unattainable by us, but to determine ourselves and our will accordingly.", "location": 692709}
{"sentence": "(Here, as we are entitled to do, we only bring under consideration in the first instance the sublime in natural Objects; for the sublime of Art is always limited by the conditions of agreement with Nature.)", "location": 228412}
{"sentence": "Such a judgement is an aesthetical judgement upon the purposiveness of the Object, which does not base itself upon any present concept of the object, nor does it furnish any such.", "location": 120581}
{"sentence": "A judgement in which we forget to consider the extent of our powers (our Understanding) may sometimes sound very humble, and yet make great pretensions, and so be very presumptuous.", "location": 788663}
{"sentence": "Additional terms will be linked to the Project Gutenberg\u2122 License for all works posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.", "location": 817985}
{"sentence": "_The principle of Taste is the subjective principle of Judgement in general_  The judgement of taste is distinguished from a logical judgement in this, that the latter subsumes a representation under the concept of the Object, while the former does not subsume it under any concept; because otherwise the necessary universal agreement [in these judgements] would be capable of being enforced by proofs.", "location": 324687}
{"sentence": "In the same way we may concede thus much as regards the case in hand.", "location": 577122}
{"sentence": "We may subdivide this free play of sensations into the _play of fortune_ [games of chance], the _play of tone_ [music], and the _play of thought_ [wit].", "location": 422883}
{"sentence": "The mental powers, therefore, whose union (in a certain relation) constitutes _genius_ are Imagination and Understanding.", "location": 390767}
{"sentence": "This last of course primarily combines and forms itself in freedom according to a certain original disposition directed towards purposes (which, as will be shown in Part II., must not be judged aesthetically but teleologically according to the principle of realism), but also perhaps in conformity with the universal law of the affinity of materials.", "location": 462233}
{"sentence": "The ground of union is \u201cthe supersensible substrate of nature of which we can determine nothing positively, except that it is the being in itself of which we merely know the phenomenon.\u201d Thus, then, it appears that the whole force of Kant\u2019s main argument has proceeded upon an assumption, viz.", "location": 59849}
{"sentence": "The analysis of the Sublime which follows that of the Beautiful is interesting and profound; indeed Schopenhauer regarded it as the best part of the Critique of the Aesthetical Judgement.", "location": 29452}
{"sentence": "The closest examination, indeed (in _Camper\u2019s_[125] judgement), of the remains of the aforesaid devastations of nature seems to show that man was not comprehended in these revolutions; but yet he is so dependent on the remaining creatures that, if a universally directing mechanism of nature be admitted in the case of the others, he must also be regarded as comprehended under it; even though his Understanding (for the most part at least) has been able to deliver him from these devastations.", "location": 630386}
{"sentence": "Now since learning is nothing but imitation, it follows that the greatest ability and teachableness (capacity) regarded _qu\u00e2_ teachableness, cannot avail for genius.", "location": 372186}
{"sentence": "Hence we do not merely say of the pleasant, _it pleases_; but, _it gratifies_.", "location": 144922}
{"sentence": "Hardly any one but a botanist knows what sort of a thing a flower ought to be; and even he, though recognising in the flower the reproductive organ of the plant, pays no regard to this natural purpose if he is passing judgement on the flower by Taste.", "location": 194860}
{"sentence": "At the basis of such a judgement--if it is not a mere judgement of sensation but a formal judgement of reflection, which imputes the same satisfaction necessarily to every one,--must lie some _a priori_ principle; which may be merely subjective (if an objective one should prove impossible for judgements of this kind), but also as such may need a Deduction, that we may thereby comprehend how an aesthetical judgement can lay claim to necessity.", "location": 328294}
{"sentence": "The latter condition of aptitude, which we might call the culture of training (discipline), is negative, and consists in the freeing of the will from the despotism of desires.", "location": 638520}
{"sentence": "And it is by the excitation of such ineffable Ideas that a great work of art affects us.", "location": 35044}

{"sentence": "Willk\u00fchr; _elective will_.", "location": 70357}
{"sentence": "As for the two antinomies of the theoretical and practical employment of the superior cognitive faculties, we have already shown their _unavoidableness_, if judgements of this kind are not referred to a supersensible substrate of the given Objects, as phenomena; and also the _possibility of their solution_, as soon as this is done.", "location": 452985}
{"sentence": "Now if the teleological principle of the production of these beings be assumed (as is inevitable), we can place at the basis of the cause of their internally purposive form either _Occasionalism_ or _Pre-established Harmony_.", "location": 616910}
{"sentence": "The object is _for me_ an object of satisfaction; by others it may be regarded quite differently--every one has his own taste.", "location": 439786}
{"sentence": "Comparison of the three specifically different kinds of           satisfaction                                                53    _Second Moment_ of the judgement of taste, viz.", "location": 4069}
{"sentence": "Only, _if_ we assume that men are to live upon the earth, then the means must be there without which they could not exist as animals, and even as rational animals (in however low a degree of rationality); and thereupon those natural things, which are indispensable in this regard, must be considered as natural purposes.", "location": 498511}
{"sentence": "And if, starting from the forms of the objects of experience, from below upwards (_a posteriori_), we wish to explain the purposiveness, which we believe is met with in experience, by appealing to a cause working in accordance with purposes, then is our explanation quite tautological and we are only mocking Reason with words.", "location": 591940}
{"sentence": "Nor is it said that these forms would not be possible in accordance with the mechanism of nature.", "location": 539480}
{"sentence": "Hence it comes about that these two kinds of maxims seem to be incapable of existing together, and consequently a Dialectic arises which leads the Judgement into error in the principle of its reflection.", "location": 536823}
{"sentence": "Hence we do not know how far the mechanical method of explanation which is possible for us may extend.", "location": 602485}
{"sentence": "We believe that we perceive in the case of the wicked the traces of a wise purposive reference, if we only see that the wanton criminal does not die before he has undergone the deserved punishment of his misdeeds.", "location": 798215}
{"sentence": "Thus this Idea gains practical reality, although all means of creating such for it in a theoretical point of view, for the explanation of nature and determination of the supreme Cause, are entirely wanting for speculative cognition.", "location": 690676}
{"sentence": "Hence can be explained what _Savary_[45] remarks in his account of Egypt, viz.", "location": 243990}
{"sentence": "For man, in reference to the manifold use which his Understanding teaches him to make of all these creatures.", "location": 627081}
{"sentence": "A festal discourse may be solid and at the same time elaborate, but without spirit.", "location": 383524}
{"sentence": "For just as Imagination and _Understanding_, in judging of the Beautiful, generate a subjective purposiveness of the mental powers by means of their harmony, so [here[46]] Imagination and _Reason_ do so by means of their conflict.", "location": 259677}
{"sentence": "And even if we reduce this to the true natural wants as to which our race is thoroughly agreed, or on the other hand, raise ever so high man\u2019s skill to accomplish his imagined purposes; yet, even thus, what man understands by happiness, and what is in fact his proper, ultimate, natural purpose (not purpose of freedom), would never be attained by him.", "location": 634437}
{"sentence": "But although the determining grounds of causality according to the concept of freedom (and the practical rules which it contains) are not resident in nature, and the sensible cannot determine the supersensible in the subject, yet this is possible conversely (not, to be sure, in respect of the cognition of nature, but as regards the effects of the supersensible upon the sensible).", "location": 132909}
{"sentence": "The master must show what the pupil is to do and how he is to do it; and the universal rules, under which at last he brings his procedure, serve rather for bringing the main points back to his remembrance when occasion requires, than for prescribing them to him.", "location": 475106}
{"sentence": "For instance, he puts forward the curious doctrine that colour in a picture is only an extraneous charm, and does not really add to the beauty of the form delineated, nay rather distracts the mind from it.", "location": 33977}
{"sentence": "We must here, generally, attend to what has been already noted, that in the Transcendental Aesthetic of Judgement we must speak solely of pure aesthetical judgements; consequently our examples are not to be taken from such beautiful or sublime objects of Nature as presuppose the concept of a purpose.", "location": 286329}

{"sentence": "_Of the kind of belief produced by a practical faith_  If we look merely to the way in which anything can be _for us_ (according to the subjective constitution of our representative powers) an Object of knowledge (_res cognoscibilis_), then our concepts will not cohere with Objects, but merely with our cognitive faculties and the use which they can make of a given representation (in a theoretical or practical point of view).", "location": 713937}
{"sentence": "_The judgement of taste rests on_ a priori _grounds_  To establish _a priori_ the connexion of the feeling of a pleasure or pain as an effect, with any representation whatever (sensation or concept) as its cause, is absolutely impossible; for that would be a [particular][23] causal relation which (with objects of experience) can always only be cognised _a posteriori_, and through the medium of experience itself.", "location": 177330}
{"sentence": "This is the Idea of _freedom_, whose reality, regarded as that of a particular kind of causality (of which the concept, theoretically considered, would be transcendent), may be exhibited by means of practical laws of pure Reason, and conformably to this, in actual actions, and, consequently, in experience.--This is the only one of all the Ideas of pure Reason, whose object is a thing of fact, and to be reckoned under the _scibilia_.", "location": 717629}
{"sentence": "Elsewhere too we should see art in everything which is made so that a representation of it in its cause must have preceded its actuality (as even in the case of the bees), though the effect could not have been _thought_ by the cause.", "location": 361444}
{"sentence": "Causal combination as thought merely by the Understanding is a connexion constituting an ever-progressive series (of causes and effects); and things which as effects presuppose others as causes cannot be reciprocally at the same time causes of these.", "location": 506928}
{"sentence": "[10] One of the various pretended contradictions in this whole distinction of the causality of nature from that of freedom is this.", "location": 762772}
{"sentence": "By J.\u00a0P. MAHAFFY,     D.D., and The Right Rev.", "location": 755001}
{"sentence": "On the other hand, a long peace generally brings about a predominant commercial spirit, and along with it, low selfishness, cowardice, and effeminacy, and debases the disposition of the people.", "location": 270552}
{"sentence": "Thus we recognise pretty clearly that the animation in both cases is merely bodily, although it is excited by Ideas of the mind; and that the feeling of health produced by a motion of the intestines corresponding to the play in question makes up that whole gratification of a gay party, which is regarded as so refined and so spiritual.", "location": 424480}
{"sentence": "Of the principle of judging of internal purposiveness in           organised beings                                           280    \u00a7 67.", "location": 11854}
{"sentence": "[78] [Second Edition.]", "location": 779181}
{"sentence": "We see that the external behaviour of other men is similar to our own, and that the most reasonable way of accounting for such behaviour is to suppose that they have minds like ourselves, that they are possessed of an active and spontaneously energising faculty, which is the seat of their personality.", "location": 47946}
{"sentence": "An Understanding into which this distinction did not enter, might say: All Objects that I know _are_, _i.e._ exist; and the possibility of some, which yet do not exist (_i.e._ the contingency or the contrasted necessity of those which do exist), might never come into the representation of such a being at all.", "location": 573780}
{"sentence": "And in this there is no depreciation of those great men to whom the human race owes so much gratitude, as compared with nature\u2019s favourites in respect of the talent for beautiful art.", "location": 373797}
{"sentence": "We need not fear that the feeling of the sublime will lose by so abstract a mode of presentation,--which is quite negative in respect of what is sensible,--for the Imagination, although it finds nothing beyond the sensible to which it can attach itself, yet feels itself unbounded by this removal of its limitations; and thus that very abstraction is a presentation of the Infinite, which can be nothing but a mere negative presentation, but which yet expands the soul.", "location": 296499}
{"sentence": "For example, the Understanding says that every change has its cause (universal law of nature); the transcendental Judgement has nothing further to do than to supply _a priori_ the condition of subsumption under the concept of the Understanding placed before it, _i.e._ the succession [in time] of the determinations of one and the same thing.", "location": 103796}
{"sentence": "No doubt, as regards the constituents got from nature without, it must only be regarded as an educt; but yet in the separation and recombination of this raw material we see such an originality in the separating and formative faculty of this kind of natural being, as is infinitely beyond the reach of art, if the attempt is made to reconstruct such vegetable products out of elements obtained by their dissection or material supplied by nature for their sustenance.", "location": 504856}
{"sentence": "A doctrine, like that of Epicurus, in which every natural phenomenon is regarded as the result of the blind drifting of atoms in accordance with purely mechanical laws, really explains nothing, and least of all explains that illusion in our teleological judgements which leads us to assume purpose where really there is none.", "location": 40380}
{"sentence": "the universal laws without which nature in general (as an object of sense) cannot be thought; and these rest upon the Categories, applied to the formal conditions of all intuition possible for us, so far as it is also given _a priori_.", "location": 103451}
{"sentence": "That is, [there is a need] to assume a morally-legislating Being outside the world, without any reference to theoretical proofs, still less to self-interest, from pure moral grounds free from all foreign influence (and consequently only subjective), on the mere recommendation of a pure practical Reason legislating by itself alone.", "location": 669957}
{"sentence": "In accordance with the above peculiarity of our Understanding it cannot happen that the whole shall contain the ground of the possibility of the connexion of the parts (which would be a contradiction in discursive cognition), but only that the _representation_ of a whole may contain the ground of the possibility of its form and the connexion of the parts belonging to it.", "location": 585293}
{"sentence": "SECOND DIVISION  DIALECTIC OF THE AESTHETICAL JUDGEMENT   \u00a7 55  A faculty of Judgement that is to be dialectical must in the first place be rationalising, _i.e._ its judgements must claim universality[99] and that _a priori_; for it is in the opposition of such judgements that Dialectic consists.", "location": 434479}
{"sentence": "If I determine the causality of a man, in respect of certain products which are only explicable by designed purposiveness, by thinking it as that of Understanding, I need not stop here, but I can ascribe to him this predicate as a well-known property and cognise him accordingly.", "location": 751647}
{"sentence": "In Science then the greatest discoverer only differs in degree from his laborious imitator and pupil; but he differs specifically from him whom Nature has gifted for beautiful Art.", "location": 373616}
{"sentence": "Formation, then, takes place by a _shooting together_, _i.e._ by a sudden solidification, not by a gradual transition from the fluid to the solid state, but all at once by a _saltus_; which transition is also called _crystallisation_.", "location": 459806}
{"sentence": "But a _Homer_ or a _Wieland_ cannot show how his Ideas, so rich in fancy and yet so full of thought, come together in his head, simply because he does not know and therefore cannot teach others.", "location": 373421}
{"sentence": "Therefore the inner perception of the inadequacy of all sensible standards for rational estimation of magnitude indicates a correspondence with rational laws; it involves a pain, which arouses in us the feeling of our supersensible destination, according to which it is purposive and therefore pleasurable to find every standard of Sensibility inadequate to the Ideas of Understanding.", "location": 258257}
{"sentence": "But if we extend our empirical representative faculty (mathematically or dynamically) to the intuition of nature, Reason inevitably intervenes, as the faculty expressing the independence of absolute totality,[53] and generates the effort of the mind, vain though it be, to make the representation of the senses adequate to this.", "location": 281938}
{"sentence": "Many salts, and also rocks, of a crystalline figure, are produced thus from a species of earth dissolved in water, we do not exactly know how.", "location": 460740}
{"sentence": "The measurement of a space (regarded as apprehension) is at the same time a description of it, and thus an objective movement in the act of Imagination and a progress.", "location": 260223}
{"sentence": "If the intuition is _a priori_ this is called construction; but if it is empirical, then the Object is displayed by means of which objective reality is assured to the concept.", "location": 447833}
{"sentence": "_Thirdly_, it shows itself not so much in the accomplishment of the proposed purpose in a presentment of a definite _concept_, as in the enunciation or expression of _aesthetical Ideas_, which contain abundant material for that very design; and consequently it represents the Imagination as free from all guidance of rules and yet as purposive in reference to the presentment of the given concept.", "location": 393064}
{"sentence": "_Spirit_, in an aesthetical sense, is the name given to the animating principle of the mind.", "location": 383815}
{"sentence": "Hence this form is not, as it were, a thing of inspiration or the result of a free swing of the mental powers, but of a slow and even painful process of improvement, by which he seeks to render it adequate to his thought, without detriment to the freedom of the play of his powers.", "location": 381893}
{"sentence": "But a thing that is to exist necessarily, on account of its objective constitution, as the final purpose of an intelligent cause, must be of the kind that in the order of purposes it is dependent on no further condition than merely its Idea.", "location": 645164}
{"sentence": "To apply the former kind of laws, _i.e._ the _universal_ laws of material nature in general, the Judgement needs no special principle of reflection, since it is there determinant because an objective principle is given to it through Understanding.", "location": 535694}
