"Title: The Logic of Hegel"
"Author: Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel"
{"paragraph": "Quite other is the case with the Logic--the first division of the\n_Encyclopaedia._ There we have the collateral authority of the\n'Science of Logic,' the larger Logic which appeared whilst Hegel was\nschoolmaster at N\u00fcrnberg. The idea of a new Logic formed the natural\nsequel to the publication of the _Phenomenology_ in 1807. In that\nyear Hegel was glad to accept, as a stop-gap and pot-boiler, the post\nof editor of the Bamberg Journal. But his interests lay in other\ndirections, and the circumstances of the time and country helped to\ndetermine their special form. 'In Bavaria,' he says in a letter[2],\n'it looks as if organisation were the current business.' A very mania\nof reform, says another, prevailed. Hegel's friend and fellow-Swabian,\nNiethammer, held an important position in the Bavarian education\noffice, and wished to employ the philosopher in the work of carrying\nout his plans of re-organising the higher education of the Protestant\nsubjects of the crown. He asked if Hegel would write a logic for school\nuse, and if he cared to become rector of a grammar school. Hegel, who\nwas already at work on his larger Logic, was only half-attracted by\nthe suggestion. 'The traditional Logic,' he replied[3], 'is a subject\non which there are text-books enough, but at the same time it is one\nwhich can by no means remain as it is: it is a thing nobody can make\nanything of: 'tis dragged along like an old heirloom, only because\na substitute--of which the want is universally felt--is not yet in\nexistence. The whole of its rules, still current, might be written\non two pages: every additional detail beyond these two is perfectly\nfruitless scholastic subtlety;--or if this logic is to get a thicker\nbody, its expansion must come from psychological paltrinesses,' Still\nless did he like the prospect of instructing in theology, as then\nrationalised. 'To write a logic and to be theological instructor is as\nbad as to be white-washer and chimney-sweep at once.' 'Shall he, who\nfor many long years built his eyry on the wild rock beside the eagle\nand learned to breathe the free air of the mountains, now learn to feed\non the carcases of dead thoughts or the still-born thoughts of the\nmoderns, and vegetate in the leaden air of mere babble[4]?'", "location": 9077}

{"paragraph": "Each of the three spheres of the logical idea proves to be a systematic\nwhole of thought-terms, and a phase of the Absolute. This is the case\nwith Being, containing the three grades of quality, quantity, and\nmeasure. Quality is, in the first place, the character identical with\nbeing: so identical, that a thing ceases to be what it is, if it loses\nits quality. Quantity, on the contrary, is the character external\nto being, and does not affect the being at all. Thus _e.g._ a house\nremains what it is, whether it be greater or smaller; and red remains\nred, whether it be brighter or darker. Measure, the third grade of\nbeing, which is the unity of the first two, is a qualitative quantity.\nAll things have their measure: _i.e._ the quantitative terms of their\nexistence, their being so or so great, does not matter within certain\nlimits; but when these limits are exceeded by an additional more or\nless, the things cease to be what they were. From measure follows the\nadvance to the second sub-division of the idea, Essence.", "location": 338062}
{"paragraph": "The essential point to keep in mind about the opposition of Form and\nContent is that the content is not formless, but has the form in its\nown self, quite as much as the form is external to it. There is thus\na doubling of form. At one time it is reflected into itself; and then\nis identical with the content. At another time it is not reflected\ninto itself, and then is the external existence, which does not at\nall affect the content. We are here in presence, implicitly, of the\nabsolute correlation of content and form: viz. their reciprocal\nrevulsion, so that content is nothing but the revulsion of form into\ncontent, and form nothing but the revulsion of content into form. This\nmutual revulsion is one of the most important laws of thought. But it\nis not explicitly brought out before the Relations of Substance and\nCausality.", "location": 511453}
{"paragraph": "102.] In Number the quantum reaches its development and perfect\nmode. Like the One, the medium in which it exists, Number involves two\nqualitative factors or functions; Annumeration or Sum, which depends on\nthe factor discreteness, and Unity, which depends on continuity.", "location": 406150}
{"paragraph": "110.] What really takes place here is that the immediacy, which still\nattaches to measure as such, is set aside. In measure, at first,\nquality and quantity itself are immediate, and measure is only their\n'relative' identity. But measure shows itself absorbed and superseded\nin the measureless: yet the measureless, although it be the negation\nof measure, is itself a unity of quantity and quality. Thus in the\nmeasureless the measure is still seen to meet only with itself.", "location": 435573}
{"paragraph": "One remark more. Throughout philosophy we do not seek merely for\ncorrect, still less for plausible definitions, whose correctness\nappeals directly to the popular imagination; we seek approved or\nverified definitions, the content of which is not assumed merely as\ngiven, but is seen and known to warrant itself, because warranted\nby the free self-evolution of thought. To apply this to the present\ncase. However correct and self-evident the definition of quantity\nusual in Mathematics may be, it will still fail to satisfy the wish to\nsee how far this particular thought is founded in universal thought,\nand in that way necessary. This difficulty, however, is not the only\none. If quantity is not reached through the action of thought, but\ntaken uncritically from our generalised image of it, we are liable\nto exaggerate the range of its validity, or even to raise it to the\nheight of an absolute category. And that such a danger is real, we see\nwhen the title of exact science is restricted to those sciences the\nobjects of which can be submitted to mathematical calculation. Here we\nhave another trace of the bad metaphysics (mentioned in \u00a7 98, note)\nwhich replace the concrete idea by partial and inadequate categories of\nunderstanding. Our knowledge would be in a very awkward predicament if\nsuch objects as freedom, law, morality, or even God Himself, because\nthey cannot be measured and calculated, or expressed in a mathematical\nformula, were to be reckoned beyond the reach of exact knowledge, and\nwe had to put up with a vague generalised image of them, leaving their\ndetails or particulars to the pleasure of each individual, to make\nout of them what he will. The pernicious consequences, to which such\na theory gives rise in practice, are at once evident. And this mere\nmathematical view, which identifies with the Idea one of its special\nstages, viz. quantity, is no other than the principle of Materialism.\nWitness the history of the scientific modes of thought, especially in\nFrance since the middle of last century. Matter, in the abstract, is\njust what, though of course there is form in it, has that form only as\nan indifferent and external attribute.", "location": 397596}
{"paragraph": "Schelling: _e.g. Darstellung meines Systems der Philosophie_ (1801),\n(_Werke,_ iv. 114): 'I call reason the absolute reason, or reason,\nin so far as it is thought as total indifference of subjective and\nobjective.'", "location": 897223}
{"paragraph": "P. 338, \u00a7 195. Cf. _Encyclop._ \u00a7 463. 'This supreme inwardising of\nideation (Vorstellung) is the supreme self-divestment of intelligence,\nreducing itself to the mere being, the general space of mere names and\nmeaningless words. The ego, which is this abstract being, is, because\nsubjectivity, at the same time the power over the different names, the\nempty link which fixes in itself series of them and keeps them in fixed\norder.'", "location": 894697}
{"paragraph": "The ordinary classification of notions, as _clear, distinct_ and\n_adequate,_ is no part of the notion; it belongs to psychology.\nNotions, in fact, are here synonymous with mental representations;\na _clear_ notion is an abstract simple representation: a _distinct_\nnotion is one where, in addition to the simplicity, there is one 'mark'\nor character emphasised as a sign for subjective cognition. There is\nno more striking mark of the formalism and decay of Logic than the\nfavourite category of the 'mark.' The _adequate_ notion comes nearer\nthe notion proper, or even the Idea: but after all it expresses only\nthe formal circumstance that a notion or representation agrees with its\nobject, that is, with an external thing.--The division into what are\ncalled _subordinate_ and _co-ordinate_ notions implies a mechanical\ndistinction of universal from particular which allows only a mere\ncorrelation of them in external comparison. Again, an enumeration\nof such kinds as _contrary_ and _contradictory, affirmative_ and\n_negative_ notions, &c, is only a chance-directed gleaning of logical\nforms which properly belong to the sphere of Being or Essence, (where\nthey have been already examined,) and which have nothing to do with\nthe specific notional character as such. The true distinctions in the\nnotion, universal, particular, and individual, may be said also to\nconstitute species of it, but only when they are kept severed from\neach other by external reflection. The immanent differentiating and\nspecifying of the notion come to sight in the judgment: for to judge is\nto specify the notion.", "location": 620624}
{"paragraph": "Reason is as cunning as it is powerful. Cunning may be said to lie\nin the inter-mediative action which, while it permits the objects to\nfollow their own bent and act upon one another till they waste away,\nand does not itself directly interfere in the process, is nevertheless\nonly working out its own aims. With this explanation, Divine Providence\nmay be said to stand to the world and its process in the capacity of\nabsolute cunning. God lets men do as they please with their particular\npassions and interests; but the result is the accomplishment of--not\ntheir plans, but His, and these differ decidedly from the ends\nprimarily sought by those whom He employs.", "location": 727564}

{"paragraph": "Those sciences, which thus got the name of philosophy, we call\n_empirical_ sciences, for the reason that they take their departure\nfrom experience. Still the essential results which they aim at and\nprovide, are laws, general propositions, a theory--the thoughts of what\nis found existing. On this ground the Newtonian physics was called\nNatural Philosophy. Hugo Grotius, again, by putting together and\ncomparing the behaviour of states towards each other as recorded in\nhistory, succeeded, with the help of the ordinary methods of general\nreasoning, in laying down certain general principles, and establishing\na theory which may be termed the Philosophy of International Law. In\nEngland this is still the usual signification of the term philosophy.\nNewton continues to be celebrated as the greatest of philosophers: and\nthe name goes down as far as the price-lists of instrument-makers.\nAll instruments, such as the thermometer and barometer, which do not\ncome under the special head of magnetic or electric apparatus, are\nstyled philosophical instruments[1]. Surely thought, and not a mere\ncombination of wood, iron, &c. ought to be called the instrument of\nphilosophy! The recent science of Political Economy in particular,\nwhich in Germany is known as Rational Economy of the State, or\nintelligent national economy, has in England especially appropriated\nthe name of philosophy.[2]", "location": 55073}
{"paragraph": "In reference also to other subjects besides God the category of Essence\nis often liable to an abstract use, by which, in the study of anything,\nits Essence is held to be something unaffected by, and subsisting in\nindependence of, its definite phenomenal embodiment. Thus we say, for\nexample, of people, that the great thing is not what they do or how\nthey behave, but what they are. This is correct, if it means that a\nman's conduct should be looked at, not in its immediacy, but only as\nit is explained by his inner self, and as a revelation of that inner\nself. Still it should be remembered that the only means by which the\nEssence and the inner self can be verified, is their appearance in\noutward reality; whereas the appeal which men make to the essential\nlife, as distinct from the material facts of conduct, is generally\nprompted by a desire to assert their own subjectivity and to elude an\nabsolute and objective judgment.", "location": 446722}

{"paragraph": "But even the Categorical judgment is to a certain extent defective. It\nfails to give due place to the function or element of particularity.\nThus 'gold is a metal,' it is true; but so are silver, copper, iron:\nand metalleity as such has no leanings to any of its particular\nspecies. In these circumstances we must advance from the Categorical to\nthe Hypothetical judgment, which may be expressed in the formula: If\n_A_ is, _B_ is. The present case exhibits the same advance as formerly\ntook place from the relation of substance to the relation of cause. In\nthe Hypothetical judgment the specific character of the content shows\nitself mediated and dependent on something else: and this is exactly\nthe relation of cause and effect. And if we were to give a general\ninterpretation to the Hypothetical judgment, we should say that it\nexpressly realises the universal in its particularising. This brings\nus to the third form of the Judgment of Necessity, the Disjunctive\njudgment. _A_ is either _B_ or _C_ or _D._ A work of poetic art is\neither epic or lyric or dramatic. Colour is either yellow or blue or\nred. The two terms in the Disjunctive judgment are identical. The genus\nis the sum total of the species, and the sum total of the species\nis the genus. This unity of the universal and the particular is the\nnotion: and it is the notion which, as we now see, forms the content of\nthe judgment.", "location": 651630}
{"paragraph": "When it means immediate being, the beginning is taken from sensation\nand perception--the initial stage in the analytical method of finite\ncognition. When it means universality, it is the beginning of the\nsynthetic method.

{"paragraph": "The Absolute is the Essence. This is the same definition as the\nprevious one that the Absolute is Being, in so far as Being likewise\nis simple self-relation. But it is at the same time higher, because\nEssence is Being that has gone into itself: that is to say, the\nsimple self-relation (in Being) is expressly put as negation of\nthe negative, as immanent self-mediation.--Unfortunately when the\nAbsolute is defined to be the Essence, the negativity which this\nimplies is often taken only to mean the withdrawal of all determinate\npredicates. This negative action of withdrawal or abstraction thus\nfalls outside of the Essence--which is thus left as a mere result apart\nfrom its premisses,--the _caput mortuum_ of abstraction. But as this\nnegativity, instead of being external to Being, is its own dialectic,\nthe truth of the latter, viz. Essence, will be Being as retired within\nitself,--immanent Being. That reflection, or light thrown into itself,\nconstitutes the distinction between Essence and immediate Being, and is\nthe peculiar characteristic of Essence itself.", "location": 440019}
{"paragraph": "Besides, even if there are not things, there are states of things, and\nphenomena of nature altogether, the character of which mainly rests on\ndefinite numbers and proportions. This is especially the case with the\ndifference of tones and their harmonic concord, which, according to a\nwell-known tradition, first suggested to Pythagoras to conceive the\nessence of things as number. Though it is unquestionably important to\nscience to trace back these phenomena to the definite numbers on which\nthey are based, it is wholly inadmissible to view the characterisation\nby thought as a whole, as merely numerical. We may certainly feel\nourselves prompted to associate the most general characteristics of\nthought with the first numbers: saying, 1 is the simple and immediate;\n2 is difference and mediation; and 3 the unity of both of these. Such\nassociations however are purely external: there is nothing in the mere\nnumbers to make them express these definite thoughts. With every step\nin this method, the more arbitrary grows the association of definite\nnumbers with definite thoughts. Thus, we may view 4 as the unity of\n1 and 3, and of the thoughts associated with them, but 4 is just as\nmuch the double of 2; similarly 9 is not merely the square of 3, but\nalso the sum of 8 and I, of 7 and 2, and so on. To attach, as do some\nsecret societies of modern times, importance to all sorts of numbers\nand figures, is to some extent an innocent amusement, but it is also a\nsign of deficiency of intellectual resource. These numbers, it is said,\nconceal a profound meaning, and suggest a deal to think about. But the\npoint in philosophy is, not what you may think, but what you do think:\nand the genuine air of thought is to be sought in thought itself, and\nnot in arbitrarily selected symbols.", "location": 421046}
{"paragraph": "After an appreciative quotation from Franz von Baader, and noting his\nreference to the theosophy of B\u00f6hme, as a work of the past from which\nthe present generation might learn the speculative interpretation of\nChristian doctrines, he reverts to the position that the only mode in\nwhich thought will admit a reconciliation with religious doctrines, is\nwhen these doctrines have learned to 'assume their worthiest phase--the\nphase of the notion, of necessity, which binds, and thus also makes\nfree everything, fact no less than thought.' But it is not from B\u00f6hme\nor his kindred that we are likely to get the example of a philosophy\nequal to the highest theme--to the comprehension of divine things. 'If\nold things are to be revived--an old phase, that is; for the burden\nof the theme is ever young--the phase of the Idea such as Plato and,\nstill better, as Aristotle conceived it, is far more deserving of being\nrecalled,--and for the further reason that the disclosure of it, by\nassimilating it into our system of ideas, is, _ipso facto,_ not merely\nan interpretation of it, but a progress of the science itself. But\nto interpret such forms of the Idea by no means lies so much on the\nsurface as to get hold of Gnostic and Cabbalistic phantasmagorias; and\nto develope Plato and Aristotle is by no means the sinecure that it is\nto note or to hint at echoes of the Idea in the medievalists.'", "location": 27869}
{"paragraph": "136.] (\u03b2) The one-and-same of this correlation (the self-relation\nfound in it) is thus immediately a negative self-relation. The\ncorrelation is in short the mediating process whereby one and the\nsame is first unaffected towards difference, and secondly is the\nnegative self-relation, which repels itself as reflection-into-self to\ndifference, and invests itself (as reflection-into-something-else) with\nexistence, whilst it conversely leads back this reflection-into-other\nto self-relation and indifference. This gives the correlation of\nForce and its Expression.", "location": 519784}
{"paragraph": "'The contracted religiosity which narrows itself to a point in the\nheart must make that heart's softening and contrition the essential\nfactor of its new birth; but it must at the same time recollect that it\nhas to do with the heart of a spirit, that the spirit is the appointed\nauthority over the heart, and that it can only have such authority so\nfar as it is itself born again. This new birth of the spirit out of\nnatural ignorance and natural error takes place through instruction and\nthrough that faith in objective truth and substance which is due to the\nwitness of the spirit. This new birth of the spirit is besides _ipso\nfacto_ a new birth of the heart out of that vanity of the one-sided\nintellect (on which it sets so much) and its discoveries that finite is\ndifferent from infinite, that philosophy must either be polytheism, or,\nin acuter minds, pantheism, &c. It is, in short, a new birth out of the\nwretched discoveries on the strength of which pious humility holds its\nhead so high against philosophy and theological science. If religiosity\npersists in clinging to its unexpanded and therefore unintelligent\nintensity, then it can be sensible only of the contrast which divides\nthis narrow and narrowing form from the intelligent expansion of\ndoctrine as such, religious not less than philosophical.'", "location": 26552}
{"paragraph": "(4) It remains to note that such phrases as 'Being and Nothing are\nthe same,' or 'The unity of Being and Nothing'--like all other\nsuch unities, that of subject and object, and others--give rise to\nreasonable objection. They misrepresent the facts, by giving an\nexclusive prominence to the unity, and leaving the difference which\nundoubtedly exists in it (because it is Being and Nothing, for example,\nthe unity of which is declared) without any express mention or notice.\nIt accordingly seems as if the diversity had been unduly put out of\ncourt and neglected. The fact is, no speculative principle can be\ncorrectly expressed by any such propositional form, for the unity has\nto be conceived _in_ the diversity, which is all the while present and\nexplicit. 'To become' is the true expression for the resultant of 'To\nbe' and 'Not to be'; it is the unity of the two; but not only is it\nthe unity, it is also inherent unrest,--the unity, which is no mere\nreference-to-self and therefore without movement, but which, through\nthe diversity of Being and Nothing that is in it, is at war within\nitself.--Determinate being, on the other hand, is this unity, or\nBecoming in this form of unity: hence all that 'is there and so,' is\none-sided and finite.

{"paragraph": "As possibility is the mere _inside_ of actuality, it is for that\nreason a mere _outside_ actuality, in other words, Contingency. The\ncontingent, roughly speaking, is what has the ground of its being\nnot in itself but in somewhat else. Such is the aspect under which\nactuality first comes before consciousness, and which is often mistaken\nfor actuality itself. But the contingent is only one side of the\nactual,--the side, namely, of reflection on somewhat else. It is the\nactual, in the signification of something merely possible. Accordingly\nwe consider the contingent to be what may or may not be, what may be\nin one way or in another, whose being or not-being, and whose being\non this wise or otherwise, depends not upon itself but on something\nelse. To overcome this contingency is, roughly speaking, the problem\nof science on the one hand; as in the range of practice, on the other,\nthe end of action is to rise above the contingency of the will, or\nabove caprice. It has however often happened, most of all in modern\ntimes, that contingency has been unwarrantably elevated, and had a\nvalue attached to it, both in nature and the world of mind, to which\nit has no just claim. Frequently Nature--to take it first,--has been\nchiefly admired for the richness and variety of its structures. Apart,\nhowever, from what disclosure it contains of the Idea, this richness\ngratifies none of the higher interests of reason, and in its vast\nvariety of structures, organic and inorganic, affords us only the\nspectacle of a contingency losing itself in vagueness. At any rate,\nthe chequered scene presented by the several varieties of animals and\nplants, conditioned as it is by outward circumstances,--the complex\nchanges in the figuration and grouping of clouds, and the like, ought\nnot to be ranked higher than the equally casual fancies of the mind\nwhich surrenders itself to its own caprices.

Appearance is higher than mere Being,--a\nricher category because it holds in combination the two elements of\nreflection-into-self and reflection-into-another: whereas Being (or\nimmediacy) still mere relationlessness and apparently rests upon itself\nalone. Still, to say that anything is _only_ an appearance suggests a\nreal flaw, which consists in this, that Appearance is still divided\nagainst itself and without intrinsic stability.

{"paragraph": "Such being the case with the nature of force, though we may consent to\nlet the world be called a manifestation of divine forces, we should\nobject to have God Himself viewed as a mere force. For force is after\nall a subordinate and finite category. At the so-called renascence of\nthe sciences, when steps were taken to trace the single phenomena of\nnature back to underlying forces, the Church branded the enterprise\nas impious. The argument of the Church was as follows. If it be the\nforces of gravitation, of vegetation, &c. which occasion the movements\nof the heavenly bodies, the growth of plants, &c., there is nothing\nleft for divine providence, and God sinks to the level of a leisurely\non-looker, surveying this play of forces. The students of nature, it is\ntrue, and Newton more than others, when they employed the reflective\ncategory of force to explain natural phenomena, have expressly pleaded\nthat the honour of God, as the Creator and Governor of the world, would\nnot thereby be impaired. Still the logical issue of this explanation\nby means of forces is that the inferential understanding proceeds to\nfix each of these forces, and to maintain them in their finitude as\nultimate. And contrasted with this deinfinitised world of independent\nforces and matters, the only terms in which it is possible still to\ndescribe God will present Him in the abstract infinity of an unknowable\nsupreme Being in some other world far away. This is precisely the\nposition of materialism, and of modern 'free-thinking,' whose theology\nignores what God is and restricts itself to the mere fact _that_ He\nis. In this dispute therefore the Church and the religious mind have\nto a certain extent the right on their side. The finite forms of\nunderstanding certainly fail to fulfil the conditions for a knowledge\neither of Nature or of the formations in the world of Mind as they\ntruly are. Yet on the other side it is impossible to overlook the\nformal right which, in the first place, entitles the empirical sciences\nto vindicate the right of thought to know the existent world in all\nthe speciality of its content, and to seek something further than the\nbare statement of mere abstract faith that God creates and governs the\nworld. When our religious consciousness, resting upon the authority of\nthe Church, teaches us that God created the world by His almighty will,\nthat He guides the stars in their courses, and vouchsafes to all His\ncreatures their existence and their well-being, the question Why? is\nstill left to answer. Now it is the answer to this question which forms\nthe common task of empirical science and of philosophy. When religion\nrefuses to recognise this problem, or the right to put it, and appeals\nto the unsearchableness of the decrees of God, it is taking up the same\nagnostic ground as is taken by the mere Enlightenment of understanding.\nSuch an appeal is no better than an arbitrary dogmatism, which\ncontravenes the express command of Christianity, to know God in spirit\nand in truth, and is prompted by a humility which is not Christian, but\nborn of ostentatious bigotry.", "location": 527527}

God as merely the Father is not yet the true\n(it is the Jewish religion where he is thus without the Son): He is\nrather beginning and end: He is his presupposition, makes himself a\npresupposition (this is only another form of distinguishing): He is the\neternal process.'", "location": 818770}

To say 'This rose is red,'\ninvolves (in virtue of the copula 'is') the coincidence of subject and\npredicate. The rose however is a concrete thing, and so is not red\nonly: it has also an odour, a specific form, and many other features\nnot implied in the predicate red. The predicate on its part is an\nabstract universal, and does not apply to the rose alone. There are\nother flowers and other objects which are red too. The subject and\npredicate in the immediate judgment touch, as it were, only in a single\npoint, but do not cover each other. The case is different with the\nnotional judgment. In pronouncing an action to be good, we frame a\nnotional judgment. Here, as we at once perceive, there is a closer and\na more intimate relation than in the immediate judgment. The predicate\nin the latter is some abstract quality which may or may not be applied\nto the subject. In the judgment of the notion the predicate is, as it\nwere, the soul of the subject, by which the subject, as the body of\nthis soul, is characterised through and through.", "location": 638807}

{"paragraph": "Gold is a metal: silver is a metal: so is copper, lead, &c. This is\nthe major premiss. Then comes the minor premiss: All these bodies\nconduct electricity; and hence results the conclusion, that all metals\nconduct electricity. The point which brings about a combination here\nis individuality in the shape of allness. But this syllogism once\nmore hands us over to another syllogism. Its mean is constituted by\nthe complete list of the individuals. That pre-supposes that over\na certain region observation and experience are completed. But the\nthings in question here are individuals; and so again we are landed\nin the progression _ad infinitum_ (i, i, i, &c.). In other words, in\nno Induction can we ever exhaust the individuals. The 'all metals,'\n'all plants,' of our statements, mean only all the metals, all the\nplants, which we have hitherto become acquainted with. Every Induction\nis consequently imperfect. One and the other observation, many it may\nbe, have been made: but all the cases, all the individuals, have not\nbeen observed. By this defect of Induction we are led on to Analogy.\nIn the syllogism of Analogy we conclude from the fact that some things\nof a certain kind possess a certain quality, that the same quality is\npossessed by other things of the same kind. It would be a syllogism of\nAnalogy, for example, if we said: In all planets hitherto discovered\nthis has been found to be the law of motion, consequently a newly\ndiscovered planet will probably move according to the same law. In the\nexperiential sciences Analogy deservedly occupies a high place, and\nhas led to results of the highest importance. Analogy is the instinct\nof reason, creating an anticipation that this or that characteristic,\nwhich experience has discovered, has its root in the inner nature or\nkind of an object, and arguing on the faith of that anticipation.\nAnalogy it should be added may be superficial or it may be thorough.\nIt would certainly be a very bad analogy to argue that since the man\nCaius is a scholar, and Titus also is a man, Titus will probably be a\nscholar too: and it would be bad because a man's learning is not an\nunconditional consequence of his manhood. Superficial analogies of\nthis kind however are very frequently met with. It is often argued,\nfor example: The earth is a celestial body, so is the moon, and it\nis therefore in all probability inhabited as well as the earth. The\nanalogy is not one whit better than that previously mentioned. That\nthe earth is inhabited does not depend on its being a celestial body,\nbut in other conditions, such as the presence of an atmosphere, and of\nwater in connexion with the atmosphere, &c.: and these are precisely\nthe conditions which the moon, so far as we know, does not possess.\nWhat has in modern times been called the Philosophy of Nature consists\nprincipally in a frivolous play with empty and external analogies,\nwhich, however, claim to be considered profound results.

{"paragraph": "(i) Kant therefore holds that the categories have their source in the\n'Ego,' and that the 'Ego' consequently supplies the characteristics\nof universality and necessity. If we observe what we have before us\nprimarily, we may describe it as a congeries or diversity: and in the\ncategories we find the simple points or units, to which this congeries\nis made to converge. The world of sense is a scene of mutual exclusion:\nits being is outside itself. That is the fundamental feature of the\nsensible. 'Now' has no meaning except in reference to a before and a\nhereafter. Red, in the same way, only subsists by being opposed to\nyellow and blue. Now this other thing is outside the sensible; which\nlatter is, only in so far as it is not the other, and only in so far\nas that other is. But thought, or the 'Ego,' occupies a position the\nvery reverse of the sensible, with its mutual exclusions, and its\nbeing outside itself. The 'I' is the primary identity--at one with\nitself and all at home in itself. The word 'I' expresses the mere act\nof bringing-to-bear-upon-self: and whatever is placed in this unit or\nfocus, is affected _by_ it and transformed into it. The 'I' is as it\nwere the crucible and the fire which consumes the loose plurality of\nsense and reduces it to unity. This is the process which Kant calls\npure apperception in distinction from the common apperception, to\nwhich the plurality it receives is a plurality still; whereas pure\napperception is rather an act by which the 'I' makes the materials\n'mine.'", "location": 204187}

{"paragraph": "A general remark may still be offered on the result to which the\nCritical philosophy led as to the nature of knowledge; a result\nwhich has grown one of the current 'idols' or axiomatic beliefs of\nthe day. In every dualistic system, and especially in that of Kant,\nthe fundamental defect makes itself visible in the inconsistency of\nunifying at one moment, what a moment before had been explained to\nbe independent and therefore incapable of unification. And then, at\nthe very moment after unification has been alleged to be the truth,\nwe suddenly come upon the doctrine that the two elements, which, in\ntheir true status of unification, had been refused all independent\nsubsistence, are only true and actual in their state of separation.\nPhilosophising of this kind wants the little penetration needed to\ndiscover, that this shuffling only evidences how unsatisfactory each\none of the two terms is. And it fails simply because it is incapable\nof bringing two thoughts together. (And in point of form there are\nnever more than two.) It argues an utter want of consistency to say,\non the one hand, that the understanding only knows phenomena, and, on\nthe other, assert the absolute character of this knowledge, by such\nstatements as 'Cognition can go no further'; 'Here is the _natural_ and\nabsolute limit of human knowledge.' But 'natural' is the wrong word\nhere. The things of nature are limited and are natural things only to\nsuch extent as they are not aware of their universal limit, or to such\nextent as their mode or quality is a limit from our point of view,\nand not from their own. No one knows, or even feels, that anything\nis a limit or defect, until he is at the same time above and beyond\nit. Living beings, for example, possess the privilege of pain which\nis denied to the inanimate: even with living beings, a single mode or\nquality passes into the feeling of a negative. For living beings as\nsuch possess within them a universal vitality, which overpasses and\nincludes the single mode; and thus, as they maintain themselves in\nthe negative of themselves, they feel the contradiction to _exist_\nwithin them. But the contradiction is within them, only in so far as\none and the same subject includes both the universality of their sense\nof life, and the individual mode which is in negation with it. This\nillustration will show how a limit or imperfection in knowledge comes\nto be termed a limit or imperfection, only when it is compared with the\nactually-present Idea of the universal, of a total and perfect. A very\nlittle consideration might show, that to call a thing finite or limited\nproves by implication the very presence of the infinite and unlimited,\nand that our knowledge of a limit can only be when the unlimited is _on\nthis side_ in consciousness.", "location": 258284}

If that were a just charge, it would only prove that all other\nsystems, where speculation has not gone beyond a subordinate stage\nof the idea,--that the Jews and Mohammedans who know God only as the\nLord,--and that even the many Christians for whom God is merely the\nmost high, unknowable, and transcendent being, are as much atheists as\nSpinoza. The so-called atheism of Spinoza is merely an exaggeration of\nthe fact that he defrauds the principle of difference or finitude of\nits due. Hence his system, as it holds that there is properly speaking\nno world, at any rate that the world has no positive being, should\nrather be styled Acosmism, These considerations will also show what is\nto be said of the charge of Pantheism. If Pantheism means, as it often\ndoes, the doctrine which takes finite things in their finitude and in\nthe complex of them to be God, we must acquit the system of Spinoza of\nthe crime of Pantheism. For in that system, finite things and the world\nas a whole are denied all truth. On the other hand, the philosophy\nwhich is Acosmism is for that reason certainly pantheistic.", "location": 579847}
