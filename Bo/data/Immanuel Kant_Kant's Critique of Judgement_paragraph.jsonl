"Title: Kant's Critique of Judgement"
"Author: Kant"
{"paragraph": "From this we are enabled to see what otherwise, though we could easily\nsurmise it, could with difficulty be maintained with certainty and\nproved, viz. that the principle of a mechanical derivation of purposive\nnatural products is consistent with the teleological, but in no way\nenables us to dispense with it. In a thing that we must judge as a\nnatural purpose (an organised being) we can no doubt try all the known\nand yet to be discovered laws of mechanical production, and even hope\nto make good progress therewith; but we can never get rid of the call\nfor a quite different ground of production for the possibility of such\na product, viz. causality by means of purposes. Absolutely no human\nReason (in fact no finite Reason like ours in quality, however much it\nmay surpass it in degree) can hope to understand the production of even\na blade of grass by mere mechanical causes. As regards the possibility\nof such an object, the teleological connexion of causes and effects\nis quite indispensable for the Judgement, even for studying it by the\nclue of experience. For external objects as phenomena an adequate\nground related to purposes cannot be met with; this, although it lies\nin nature, must only be sought in the supersensible substrate of\nnature, from all possible insight into which we are cut off. Hence it\nis absolutely impossible for us to produce from nature itself grounds\nof explanation for purposive combinations; and it is necessary by the\nconstitution of the human cognitive faculties to seek the supreme\nground of these purposive combinations in an original Understanding as\nthe cause of the world.", "location": 589464}
{"paragraph": "For example, rivers bring down with them all kinds of earth serviceable\nfor the growth of plants which sometimes is deposited inland, often\nalso at their mouths. The tide brings this mud to many coasts over\nthe land or deposits it on the shore; and so, more especially if men\ngive their aid so that the ebb shall not carry it back again, the\nfruit-bearing land increases in area, and the vegetable kingdom gains\nthe place which formerly was the habitation of fish and shells. In\nthis way has nature itself brought about most of the extensions of the\nland, and still continues to do so, although very slowly.--Now the\nquestion is whether this is to be judged a purpose of nature, because\nit contains utility for men. We cannot put it down to the account of\nthe vegetable kingdom, because just as much is subtracted from sea-life\nas is added to land-life.", "location": 495091}
{"paragraph": "The _humorous_ manner again may be classified as that which, as\nexhilarating us, is near akin to the gratification that proceeds\nfrom laughter; and belongs to the originality of spirit, but not to\nthe talent of beautiful art. _Humour_ in the good sense means the\ntalent of being able voluntarily to put oneself into a certain mental\ndisposition, in which everything is judged quite differently from the\nordinary method (reversed, in fact), and yet in accordance with certain\nrational principles in such a frame of mind. He who is involuntarily\nsubject to such mutations is called _a man of humours_ [launisch]; but\nhe who can assume them voluntarily and purposively (on behalf of a\nlively presentment brought about by the aid of a contrast that excites\na laugh)--he and his manner of speech are called _humorous_ [launigt].\nThis manner, however, belongs rather to pleasant than to beautiful art,\nbecause the object of the latter must always exhibit intrinsic worth,\nand hence requires a certain seriousness in the presentation, as taste\ndoes in the act of judgement.", "location": 433408}
{"paragraph": "Suppose the case of a man at the moment when his mind is disposed to a\nmoral sensation. If surrounded by the beauties of nature, he is in a\nstate of restful, serene enjoyment of his being, he feels a want, viz.\nto be grateful for this to some being or other. Or if another time he\nfinds himself in the same state of mind when pressed by duties that he\ncan and will only adequately discharge by a voluntary sacrifice, he\nagain feels in himself a want, viz. to have thus executed a command\nand obeyed a Supreme Lord. Or, again; if he has in some heedless way\ntransgressed his duty, but without becoming answerable to men, his\nsevere self-reproach will speak to him with the voice of a judge to\nwhom he has to give account. In a word, he needs a moral Intelligence,\nin order to have a Being for the purpose of his existence, which may\nbe, conformably to this purpose, the cause of himself and of the\nworld. It is vain to assign motives behind these feelings, for they\nare immediately connected with the purest moral sentiment, because\n_gratitude_, _obedience_, and _humiliation_ (submission to deserved\nchastisement) are mental dispositions that make for duty; and the mind\nwhich is inclined towards a widening of its moral sentiment here only\nvoluntarily conceives an object that is not in the world in order where\npossible to render its duty before such an one. It is therefore at\nleast possible and grounded too in our moral disposition to represent\na pure moral need of the existence of a Being, by which our morality\ngains strength or even (at least according to our representation) more\nscope, viz. a new object for its exercise. That is, [there is a need]\nto assume a morally-legislating Being outside the world, without any\nreference to theoretical proofs, still less to self-interest, from pure\nmoral grounds free from all foreign influence (and consequently only\nsubjective), on the mere recommendation of a pure practical Reason\nlegislating by itself alone. And although such a mental disposition\nmight seldom occur or might not last long, but be transient and without\npermanent effect, or might even pass away without any meditation on the\nobject represented in such shadowy outline, or without care to bring\nit under clear concepts--there is yet here unmistakably the ground why\nour moral capacity, as a subjective principle, should not be contented\nin its contemplation of the world with its purposiveness by means of\nnatural causes, but should ascribe to it a supreme Cause governing\nnature according to moral principles.--In addition, we feel ourselves\nconstrained by the moral law to strive for a universal highest purpose\nwhich yet we, in common with the rest of nature, are incapable of\nattaining; and it is only so far as we strive for it that we can judge\nourselves to be in harmony with the final purpose of an intelligent\nWorld Cause (if such there be). Thus is found a pure moral ground\nof practical Reason for assuming this Cause (since it can be done\nwithout contradiction), in order that we may no more regard that effort\nof Reason as quite idle, and so run the risk of abandoning it from\nweariness.", "location": 668324}

{"paragraph": "The actuality of a highest morally-legislating Author is therefore\nsufficiently established merely _for the practical use_ of our Reason,\nwithout determining anything theoretically as regards its being. For\nReason requires, in respect of the possibility of its purpose, which\nis given to us independently by its own legislation, an Idea through\nwhich the inability to follow up this purpose, according to the mere\nnatural concepts of the world, is removed (sufficiently for the\nreflective Judgement). Thus this Idea gains practical reality, although\nall means of creating such for it in a theoretical point of view, for\nthe explanation of nature and determination of the supreme Cause,\nare entirely wanting for speculative cognition. For the theoretical\nreflective Judgement physical Teleology sufficiently proves from the\npurposes of nature an intelligent World-Cause; for the practical\nJudgement moral Teleology establishes it by the concept of a final\npurpose, which it is forced to ascribe to creation in a practical\npoint of view. The objective reality of the Idea of God, as moral\nAuthor of the world, cannot, it is true, be established by physical\npurposes _alone_. But nevertheless, if the cognition of these purposes\nis combined with that of the moral purpose, they are, by virtue of the\nmaxim of pure Reason which bids us seek unity of principles so far as\nis possible, of great importance for the practical reality of that\nIdea, by bringing in the reality which it has for the Judgement in a\ntheoretical point of view.", "location": 690175}
{"paragraph": "One cannot blame the ancients much, if they thought of their gods as\ndiffering much from each other both as regards their faculties and as\nregards their designs and volitions, but yet thought of all of them,\nthe Supreme One not excepted, as always limited after human fashion.\nFor if they considered the arrangement and the course of things in\nnature, they certainly found ground enough for assuming something\nmore than mechanism as its cause, and for conjecturing behind the\nmachinery of this world designs of certain higher causes, which they\ncould not think otherwise than superhuman. But because they met with\ngood and evil, the purposive and the unpurposive, mingled together (at\nleast as far as our insight goes), and could not permit themselves\nto assume nevertheless that wise and benevolent purposes of which\nthey saw no proof lay hidden at bottom, on behalf of the arbitrary\nIdea of a supremely perfect original Author, their judgement upon\nthe supreme World Cause could hardly have been other than it was, so\nlong as they proceeded consistently according to maxims of the mere\ntheoretical use of Reason. Others, who wished to be theologians as\nwell as physicists, thought to find contentment for the Reason by\nproviding for the absolute unity of the principle of natural things\nwhich Reason demands, the Idea of a Being of which as sole Substance\nthe things would be all only inherent determinations. This Substance\nwould not be Cause of the World by means of intelligence, but in it all\nthe intelligences of the beings in the world would be comprised. This\nBeing consequently would produce nothing according to purposes; but in\nit all things, on account of the unity of the subject of which they are\nmere determinations, must necessarily relate themselves purposively to\none another, though without purpose and design. Thus they introduced\nthe Idealism of final causes, by changing the unity (so difficult to\nexplain) of a number of purposively combined substances, from being\nthe unity of causal dependence _on one_ Substance to be the unity of\ninherence _in one_. This system--which in the sequel, considered on the\nside of the inherent world beings, becomes _Pantheism_, and (later) on\nthe side of the Subject subsisting by itself as Original Being, becomes\n_Spinozism_,--does not so much resolve as explain away into nothing the\nquestion of the first ground of the purposiveness of nature; because\nthis latter concept, bereft of all reality, must be taken for a mere\nmisinterpretation of a universal ontological concept of a thing in\ngeneral.", "location": 652760}
{"paragraph": "In receiving a quantum into the Imagination by intuition, in order\nto be able to use it for a measure or as a unit for the estimation\nof magnitude by means of numbers, there are two operations of\nthe Imagination involved: _apprehension_ (_apprehensio_) and\n_comprehension_ (_comprehensio aesthetica_). As to apprehension there\nis no difficulty, for it can go on _ad infinitum_; but comprehension\nbecomes harder the further apprehension advances, and soon attains to\nits maximum, viz. the aesthetically greatest fundamental measure for\nthe estimation of magnitude. For when apprehension has gone so far that\nthe partial representations of sensuous intuition at first apprehended\nbegin to vanish in the Imagination, whilst this ever proceeds to the\napprehension of others, then it loses as much on the one side as it\ngains on the other; and in comprehension there is a maximum beyond\nwhich it cannot go.", "location": 243087}
{"paragraph": "This difference consists, however, in the fact that the Idea in\nquestion is not a rational principle for the Understanding but\nfor the Judgement. It is, therefore, merely the application of an\nUnderstanding in general to possible objects of experience, in cases\nwhere the judgement can only be reflective, not determinant, and where,\nconsequently, the object, although given in experience, cannot be\n_determinately judged_ in conformity with the Idea (not to say with\ncomplete adequacy), but can only be reflected on.", "location": 579353}

{"paragraph": "It is infinitely important for Reason not to let slip the mechanism\nof nature in its products, and in their explanation not to pass it\nby, because without it no insight into the nature of things can be\nattained. Suppose it admitted that a supreme Architect immediately\ncreated the forms of nature as they have been from the beginning, or\nthat He predetermined those which in the course of nature continually\nform themselves on the same model. Our knowledge of nature is not thus\nin the least furthered, because we cannot know the mode of action of\nthat Being and the Ideas which are to contain the principles of the\npossibility of natural beings, and we cannot by them explain nature\nas from above downwards (_a priori_). And if, starting from the forms\nof the objects of experience, from below upwards (_a posteriori_),\nwe wish to explain the purposiveness, which we believe is met with\nin experience, by appealing to a cause working in accordance with\npurposes, then is our explanation quite tautological and we are only\nmocking Reason with words. Indeed when we lose ourselves with this way\nof explanation in the transcendent, whither natural knowledge cannot\nfollow, Reason is seduced into poetical extravagance, which it is its\npeculiar destination to avoid.", "location": 591218}
{"paragraph": "But under the _sensus communis_ we must include the Idea of a\n_communal_ sense, _i.e._ of a faculty of judgement, which in its\nreflection takes account (_a priori_) of the mode of representation\nof all other men in thought; in order _as it were_ to compare its\njudgement with the collective Reason of humanity, and thus to escape\nthe illusion arising from the private conditions that could be so\neasily taken for objective, which would injuriously affect the\njudgement. This is done by comparing our judgement with the possible\nrather than the actual judgements of others, and by putting ourselves\nin the place of any other man, by abstracting from the limitations\nwhich contingently attach to our own judgement. This, again, is\nbrought about by leaving aside as much as possible the matter of our\nrepresentative state, _i.e._ sensation, and simply having respect to\nthe formal peculiarities of our representation or representative state.\nNow this operation of reflection seems perhaps too artificial to be\nattributed to the faculty called _common_ sense; but it only appears\nso, when expressed in abstract formulae. In itself there is nothing\nmore natural than to abstract from charm or emotion if we are seeking a\njudgement that is to serve as a universal rule.", "location": 339673}

Hence the object is only called purposive, when its\nrepresentation is immediately combined with the feeling of pleasure;\nand this very representation is an aesthetical representation of\npurposiveness.--The only question is whether there is, in general, such\na representation of purposiveness.", "location": 118501}

It can, as philosophy, prove\nthem on _a priori_ grounds, but it cannot demonstrate them; unless\nwe wish to depart entirely from the proper meaning of this word,\naccording to which _to demonstrate_ (_ostendere_, _exhibere_) is\nequivalent to presenting a concept in intuition (whether in proof or\nmerely in definition). If the intuition is _a priori_ this is called\nconstruction; but if it is empirical, then the Object is displayed by\nmeans of which objective reality is assured to the concept. Thus we say\nof an anatomist that he demonstrates the human eye, if by a dissection\nof this organ he makes intuitively evident the concept which he has\npreviously treated discursively.", "location": 447151}
{"paragraph": "But in the solution given above of the Antinomy of the principles\nof the mechanical and teleological methods of production of organic\nbeings of nature, we have seen that they are merely principles of\nthe reflective Judgement in respect of nature as it produces forms\nin accordance with particular laws (for the systematic connexion of\nwhich we have no key). They do not determine the origin of these\nbeings in themselves; but only say that we, by the constitution of\nour Understanding and our Reason, cannot conceive it in this kind of\nbeing except according to final causes. The greatest possible effort,\neven audacity, in the attempt to explain them mechanically is not only\npermitted, but we are invited to it by Reason; notwithstanding that\nwe know from the subjective grounds of the particular species and\nlimitations of our Understanding (not _e.g._ because the mechanism\nof production would contradict in itself an origin according to\npurposes) that we can never attain thereto. Finally, the compatibility\nof both ways of representing the possibility of nature may lie in\nthe supersensible principle of nature (external to us, as well as in\nus); whilst the method of representation according to final causes\nmay be only a subjective condition of the use of our Reason, when it\nnot merely wishes to form a judgement upon objects as phenomena, but\ndesires to refer these phenomena together with their principles to\ntheir supersensible substrate, in order to find certain laws of their\nunity possible, which it cannot represent to itself except through\npurposes (of which the Reason also has such as are supersensible).", "location": 631271}
{"paragraph": "If we consider the vegetable kingdom we might at first sight, on\naccount of the immeasurable fertility with which it spreads itself\nalmost on every soil, be led to take it for a mere product of that\nmechanism which nature displays in the formations of the mineral\nkingdom. But a more intimate knowledge of its indescribably wise\norganisation does not permit us to hold to this thought, but prompts\nthe question: What are these things created for? If it is answered:\nFor the animal kingdom, which is thereby nourished and has thus been\nable to spread over the earth in genera so various, then the further\nquestion comes: What are these plant-devouring animals for? The answer\nwould be something like this: For beasts of prey, which can only be\nnourished by that which has life. Finally we have the question: What\nare these last, as well as the first-mentioned natural kingdoms, good\nfor? For man, in reference to the manifold use which his Understanding\nteaches him to make of all these creatures. He is the ultimate purpose\nof creation here on earth, because he is the only being upon it who\ncan form a concept of purposes, and who can by his Reason make out of\nan aggregate of purposively formed things a system of purposes.", "location": 626194}
{"paragraph": "On the contrary, pleasure in the Beautiful is neither a pleasure\nof enjoyment nor of a law-abiding activity, nor even of rational\ncontemplation in accordance with Ideas, but of mere reflection. Without\nhaving as rule any purpose or fundamental proposition, this pleasure\naccompanies the ordinary apprehension of an object by the Imagination,\nas faculty of intuition, in relation with the Understanding, as faculty\nof concepts, by means of a procedure of the Judgement which it must\nalso exercise on behalf of the commonest experience; only that in\nthe latter case it is in order to perceive an empirical objective\nconcept, in the former case (in aesthetical judgements) merely to\nperceive the accordance of the representation with the harmonious\n(subjectively purposive) activity of both cognitive faculties in their\nfreedom, _i.e._ to feel with pleasure the mental state produced by\nthe representation. This pleasure must necessarily depend for every\none on the same conditions, for they are subjective conditions of the\npossibility of a cognition in general; and the proportion between\nthese cognitive faculties requisite for Taste is also requisite for\nthat ordinary sound Understanding which we have to presuppose in\nevery one. Therefore he who judges with taste (if only he does not go\nastray in this act of consciousness and mistake matter for form or\ncharm for beauty) may impute to every one subjective purposiveness,\n_i.e._ his satisfaction in the Object, and may assume his feeling to be\nuniversally communicable and that without the mediation of concepts.", "location": 336951}
{"paragraph": "Purposiveness may be represented in an object given in experience\non a merely subjective ground, as the harmony of its form,--in the\n_apprehension_ (_apprehensio_) of it prior to any concept,--with the\ncognitive faculties, in order to unite the intuition with concepts\nfor a cognition generally. Or it may be represented objectively as\nthe harmony of the form of the object with the possibility of the\nthing itself, according to a concept of it which precedes and contains\nthe ground of this form. We have seen that the representation of\npurposiveness of the first kind rests on the immediate pleasure\nin the form of the object in the mere reflection upon it. But the\nrepresentation of purposiveness of the second kind, since it refers\nthe form of the Object, not to the cognitive faculties of the subject\nin the apprehension of it, but to a definite cognition of the object\nunder a given concept, has nothing to do with a feeling of pleasure in\nthings, but only with the Understanding in its judgement upon them.\nIf the concept of an object is given, the business of the Judgement\nin the use of the concept for cognition consists in _presentation_\n(_exhibitio_), _i.e._ in setting a corresponding intuition beside the\nconcept. This may take place either through our own Imagination, as\nin Art when we realise a preconceived concept of an object which is\na purpose of ours; or through Nature in its Technic (as in organised\nbodies) when we supply to it our concept of its purpose in order\nto judge of its products. In the latter case it is not merely the\n_purposiveness_ of nature in the form of the thing that is represented,\nbut this its product is represented as a _natural purpose_.--Although\nour concept of a subjective purposiveness of nature in its forms\naccording to empirical laws is not a concept of the Object, but only\na principle of the Judgement for furnishing itself with concepts amid\nthe immense variety of nature (and thus being able to ascertain its\nown position), yet we thus ascribe to nature as it were a regard to\nour cognitive faculty according to the analogy of purpose. Thus we can\nregard _natural beauty_ as the _presentation_ of the concept of the\nformal (merely subjective) purposiveness, and _natural purposes_ as\nthe presentation of the concept of a real (objective) purposiveness.\nThe former of these we judge of by Taste (aesthetically, by the medium\nof the feeling of pleasure), the latter by Understanding and Reason\n(logically, according to concepts).", "location": 125612}
{"paragraph": "But in the family of the higher cognitive faculties there is a middle\nterm between the Understanding and the Reason. This is the _Judgement_,\nof which we have cause for supposing according to analogy that it\nmay contain in itself, if not a special legislation, yet a special\nprinciple of its own to be sought according to laws, though merely\nsubjective _a priori_.

{"paragraph": "If then we speak of intellectual beauty or sublimity, these expressions\nare, _first_, not quite accurate, because beauty and sublimity are\naesthetical modes of representation, which would not be found in us at\nall if we were pure intelligences (or even regarded ourselves as such\nin thought). _Secondly_, although both, as objects of an intellectual\n(moral) satisfaction, are so far compatible with aesthetical\nsatisfaction that they _rest_ upon no interest, yet they are difficult\nto unite with it, because they are meant to _produce_ an interest.\nThis, if its presentation is to harmonise with the satisfaction in the\naesthetical judgement, could only arise by means of a sensible interest\nthat we combine with it in the presentation; and thus damage would be\ndone to the intellectual purposiveness, and it would lose its purity.", "location": 289044}
{"paragraph": "Now it is quite indeterminate, and for our Understanding always\nindeterminable, how much the mechanism of nature does as a means\ntowards each final design in nature.

Hence we do not know how far the mechanical method of\nexplanation which is possible for us may extend. So much only is\ncertain that, so far as we can go in this direction, it must always\nbe inadequate for things that we once recognise as natural purposes;\nand therefore we must, by the constitution of our Understanding,\nsubordinate these grounds collectively to a teleological principle.", "location": 602004}
{"paragraph": "It is to be observed, however, that precisely similar arguments might\nbe urged against our affirmation of purpose, design, will, as the\nspring of the actions of other human beings.[3] For let us consider\nwhy it is that, mind being assumed as the basis of our own individual\nconsciousness, we go on to attribute minds of like character to other\nmen. We see that the external behaviour of other men is similar to our\nown, and that the most reasonable way of accounting for such behaviour\nis to suppose that they have minds like ourselves, that they are\npossessed of an active and spontaneously energising faculty, which is\nthe seat of their personality. But it is instructive to observe that\nneither on Kantian principles nor on any other can we _demonstrate_\nthis; to cross the chasm which separates one man\u2019s personality from\nanother\u2019s requires a venture of faith just as emphatically as any\ntheological formula. I can by no means _prove_ to the determinant\nJudgement that the complex of sensations which I constantly experience,\nand which I call the Prime Minister, is anything more than a\nwell-ordered machine. It is improbable that this is the case--highly\nimprobable; but the falsity of such an hypothesis cannot be proved in\nthe same way that we would prove the falsity of the assertion that two\nand two make five. But then though the hypothesis cannot be thus ruled\nout of court by demonstration of its absurdity, it is not the simplest\nhypothesis, nor is it that one which best accounts for the facts. The\nassumption, on the other hand, that the men whom I meet every day have\nminds like my own, perfectly accounts for all the facts, and is a very\nsimple assumption. It merely extends by induction the sphere of a force\nwhich I already know to exist. Or in other words, crude materialism not\ngiving me an intelligent account of my own individual consciousness,\nI recognise mind, \u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2, as a _vera causa_, as something which really\ndoes produce effects in the field of experience, and which therefore I\nmay legitimately put forward as the cause of those actions of other\nmen which externally so much resemble my own. But, as has been said\nbefore, this argument, though entirely convincing to any sane person,\nis not demonstrative; in Kantian language and on Kantian principles\nthe reasoning here used would seem to be valid only for the reflective\nand not for the determinant Judgement. If the principle of design or\nconscious adaptation of means to ends be not a constitutive principle\nof experience, but only a regulative principle introduced to account\nfor the facts, what right have we to put it forward dogmatically as\naffording an explanation of the actions of other human beings?", "location": 47597}

If the pleasure taken in\nbeauty arises from a feeling of the purposiveness of the object in\nits relation to the subject, that in sublimity rather expresses a\npurposiveness of the subject in respect of the object.

So much is\nclear, that if we regard this as a purpose of nature, we must also\nregard the sand as a relative purpose, in reference to which the ocean\nstrand and its withdrawal were means: for in the series of the mutually\nsubordinated members of a purposive combination, every member must be\nregarded as a purpose (though not as a final purpose), to which its\nproximate cause is the means.

It is a merely relative purposiveness\ncontingent upon the thing to which it is ascribed; and although in the\nexamples we have cited, the different kinds of grass are to be judged\nas in themselves organised products of nature, and consequently as\nartificial, yet are they to be regarded, in reference to the beasts\nwhich feed upon them, as mere raw material.", "location": 495946}

Now, because the concepts\nin a judgement constitute its content (what belongs to the cognition\nof the Object), but the judgement of taste is not determinable by\nconcepts, it is based only on the subjective formal condition of a\njudgement in general. The subjective condition of all judgements is\nthe faculty of Judgement itself. This when used with reference to a\nrepresentation by which an object is given, requires the accordance\nof two representative powers: viz. Imagination (for the intuition and\ncomprehension of the manifold) and Understanding (for the concept as\na representation of the unity of this comprehension). Now because no\nconcept of the Object lies here at the basis of the judgement, it can\nonly consist in the subsumption of the Imagination itself (in the case\nof a representation by which an object is given) under the conditions\nthat the Understanding requires to pass from intuition to concepts.\nThat is, because the freedom of the Imagination consists in the fact\nthat it schematises without any concept, the judgement of taste must\nrest on a mere sensation of the reciprocal activity of the Imagination\nin its _freedom_ and the Understanding with its _conformity to law_.\nIt must therefore rest on a feeling, which makes us judge the object\nby the purposiveness of the representation (by which an object is\ngiven) in respect of the furtherance of the cognitive faculty in its\nfree play.

Further, if the mind is concerned with comparisons, the\nImagination can, in all probability, actually though unconsciously let\none image glide into another, and thus by the concurrence of several of\nthe same kind come by an average, which serves as the common measure\nof all. Every one has seen a thousand full-grown men. Now if you wish\nto judge of their normal size, estimating it by means of comparison,\nthe Imagination (as I think) allows a great number of images (perhaps\nthe whole thousand) to fall on one another. If I am allowed to apply\nhere the analogy of optical presentation, it is in the space where\nmost of them are combined and inside the contour, where the place is\nilluminated with the most vivid colours, that the _average size_ is\ncognisable; which, both in height and breadth, is equally far removed\nfrom the extreme bounds of the greatest and smallest stature. And this\nis the stature of a beautiful man. (We could arrive at the same thing\nmechanically, by adding together all thousand magnitudes, heights,\nbreadths, and thicknesses, and dividing the sum by a thousand. But the\nImagination does this by means of a dynamical effect, which arises\nfrom the various impressions of such figures on the organ of internal\nsense.) If now in a similar way for this average man we seek the\naverage head, for this head the average nose, etc., such figure is at\nthe basis of the normal Idea in the country where the comparison is\ninstituted. Thus necessarily under these empirical conditions a negro\nmust have a different normal Idea of the beauty of the [human figure]\nfrom a white man, a Chinaman a different normal Idea from a European,\netc. And the same is the case with the model of a beautiful horse or\ndog (of a certain breed).--This _normal Idea_ is not derived from\nproportions got from experience [and regarded] _as definite rules_; but\nin accordance with it rules for judging become in the first instance\npossible. It is the image for the whole race, which floats among all\nthe variously different intuitions of individuals, which nature takes\nas archetype in her productions of the same species, but which seems\nnot to be fully reached in any individual case. It is by no means the\nwhole _archetype of beauty_ in the race, but only the form constituting\nthe indispensable condition of all beauty, and thus merely\n_correctness_ in the [mental] presentation of the race. It is, like the\ncelebrated _Doryphorus_ of _Polycletus_,[36] the _rule_ (_Myron\u2019s_[37]\nCow might also be used thus for its kind). It can therefore contain\nnothing specifically characteristic, for otherwise it would not be\nthe _normal Idea_ for the race.

To this is to be added our admiration for Nature, which displays\nitself in its beautiful products as Art, not merely by chance, but\nas it were designedly, in accordance with a regular arrangement, and\nas purposiveness without purpose.

If I\nchoose, _e.g._ to regard a maggot as the product of the mere mechanism\nof nature (of the new formation that it produces of itself, when\nits elements are set free by corruption), I cannot derive the same\nproduct from the same matter as from a causality that acts according\nto purposes. Conversely, if I regard the same product as a natural\npurpose, I cannot count on any mechanical mode of its production and\nregard this as the constitutive principle of my judgement upon its\npossibility, and so unite both principles. One method of explanation\nexcludes the other; even supposing that objectively both grounds of\nthe possibility of such a product rested on a single ground, to which\nwe did not pay attention. The principle which should render possible\nthe compatibility of both in judging of nature must be placed in\nthat which lies outside both (and consequently outside the possible\nempirical representation of nature), but yet contains their ground,\n_i.e._ in the supersensible; and each of the two methods of explanation\nmust be referred thereto. Now of this we can have no concept but the\nindeterminate concept of a ground, which makes the judging of nature\nby empirical laws possible, but which we cannot determine more nearly\nby any predicate. Hence the union of both principles cannot rest upon\na ground of _explanation_ of the possibility of a product according to\ngiven laws, for the _determinant_ Judgement, but only upon a ground\nof its _exposition_ for the _reflective_ Judgement.--To explain is to\nderive from a principle, which therefore we must clearly know and of\nwhich we can give an account. No doubt the principle of the mechanism\nof nature and that of its causality in one and the same natural product\nmust coalesce in a single higher principle, which is their common\nsource, because otherwise they could not subsist side by side in the\nobservation of nature. But if this principle, objectively common to\nthe two, which therefore warrants the association of the maxims of\nnatural investigation depending on both, be such that, though it\ncan be pointed to, it cannot be determinately known nor clearly put\nforward for use in cases which arise, then from such a principle we\ncan draw no explanation, _i.e._ no clear and determinate derivation\nof the possibility of a natural product in accordance with those\ntwo heterogeneous principles. But now the principle common to the\nmechanical and teleological derivations is the _supersensible_, which\nwe must place at the basis of nature, regarded as phenomenon. And of\nthis, in a theoretical point of view, we cannot form the smallest\npositive determinate concept. It cannot, therefore, in any way be\nexplained how, according to it as principle, nature (in its particular\nlaws) constitutes for us one system, which can be cognised as possible\neither by the principle of physical development or by that of final\ncauses. If it happens that objects of nature present themselves which\ncannot be thought by us, as regards their possibility, according to\nthe principle of mechanism (which always has a claim on a natural\nbeing), without relying on teleological propositions, we can only make\nan hypothesis. Namely, we suppose that we may hopefully investigate\nnatural laws with reference to both (according as the possibility of\nits product is cognisable by our Understanding by one or the other\nprinciple), without stumbling at the apparent contradiction which comes\ninto view between the principles by which they are judged.
