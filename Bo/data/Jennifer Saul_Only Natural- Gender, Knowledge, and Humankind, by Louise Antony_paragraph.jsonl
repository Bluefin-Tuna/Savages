{"paragraph": "1. A personal anecdote\nI\u2019ll begin the contextualising with a personal anecdote. Back in the early 1990s,\nI was a graduate student at Princeton. I was fascinated by analytic philosophy of\nlanguage, but I also had a passion for feminist politics. I was especially drawn to\nH.P. Grice, and also to direct reference and substitution puzzle cases involving\nnames. Supervised by Scott Soames, I unsurprisingly found myself working on\nthe pragmatic theory that direct reference theorists could use to defend themselves against objections. But I still loved feminism\u2014I just couldn\u2019t see any way\nto combine it with philosophy of language. There really was almost no analytic feminist philosophy at the time, and it was incredibly difficult to find what\nexisted. Pre-internet, to search for a topic meant physically looking it up in\nyear volume after year volume of The Philosopher\u2019s Index\u2014and there was almost\nnothing there. Imagine my delight, then, to come across an article on feminism\nthat discussed theories of reference\u2014my heart leapt with the thought that it\nmight just be possible to combine my interests. This was \u2018How Can Language\nBe Sexist?\u2019 by Merrill and Jaakko Hintikka (Hintikka and Hintikka 1983), and\nit got off to a great start from my perspective, suggesting that \u2018a number of sexist\nuses of language illustrate interesting general theoretical problems. The diagnosis of such sexist uses hence involves serious problems of theoretical semantics\u2019\n(p. 155). I read on, and discovered that a major theme of the paper was women\u2019s\ntendency to think in terms of relations and men\u2019s to think in terms of individuals\u2014and a key example of male bias was direct reference theorists\u2019 views\non names. I had finally found people combining feminism and philosophy of\nlanguage, and they were telling me (or so it felt) that my research project was\nnothing but a pile of male bias, which no feminist should be pursuing. In the\nearly years of my career, they were not the only ones. Jennifer Hornsby (2000)\nagain took up the idea that individualism was male, using this to suggest\u2014as I\nread her\u2014that one could not be a feminist and a Gricean. (I actually don\u2019t think\nof myself as an individualist, but I am a Gricean.)\nMind, Vol. XX . XX . XX 2024\b", "location": 2803}

{"paragraph": "3. Antony in defence of individualism\nAntony argues against feminist attacks on individualism in multiple ways. One\nimportant strand of argument is her criticism of what she calls an \u2018etiological\napproach\u2019. An approach like this assesses views and methodologies on the basis\nof their origins, and in this case dismisses certain approaches or claims as male\nin origin and therefore either wrong or not suitable for feminists. This is the line\nof thought which gives rise to terms like \u2018malestream\u2019 (characteristic of some\nsecond-wave feminists, and used in Hornsby\u2019s article). It allows for quite sweeping condemnations of philosophical approaches such as individualism. As we\u2019ve\nseen, the accusation of \u2018maleness\u2019 can be simply about the sex/gender of those who\nfounded the approach, or about the approach arising from traits that are in some\nway male\u2014such as a quest for separation rather than connection.\nAntony\u2019s first point is that this attention to maleness of origins is often\nquite selective. So, as she points out in her discussion of Hornsby, feminist philosophers may criticize malestream philosophy while at the same time happily\nusing ideas from male theorists other than those that they criticize. Her argument against this is simple yet important:\n[V]irtually everything in the philosophical canon was produced by men.\nIf, as many of us believe, all views are shaped equally by the social positions of their authors, it is surpassingly likely that any philosophical position that is subjected to scrutiny will come out of the examination looking\nmale.... Since all views are shaped by the perspectives of their authors any\ncharge of partiality against any view will be sustained. But if the charge of\nbias is levelled only selectively the bias in the uncriticized views is never\nMind, Vol. XX . XX . XX 2024\b", "location": 16303}

{"paragraph": "an idea of linguistic meaning except in situations where speaker and audience\nunderstand one another. Both of these claims are difficult to reconcile with systematic semantic theory. But they are also difficult to reconcile with the excellent work done by Hornsby (Hornsby 1993) and Rae Langton (Langton 1993)\non the ways that women\u2019s communication can be stymied by a failure to understand brought on by cultural forces like pornography. On Hornsby\u2019s view of\nlinguistic meaning, a woman whose \u2018no\u2019 isn\u2019t understood has not uttered anything whose linguistic meaning is no. This is a stronger conclusion than either\nHornsby or Langton endorses in these papers.Hornsby\u2019s claims, then, really\ndo seem implausibly strong\u2014and a clear result of her dismissal of anything\nremotely individualistic. Antony\u2019s criticism is also overblown, taking Hornsby\nto be more hostile to semantic theory than she is\u2014and also, perhaps, taking\nher to be more hostile to those who make use of individualism than she is.\nHornsby never says anything remotely like what Antony attributes to her in the\nAyn Rand quotation: she doesn\u2019t argue that individualism will corrupt people\npolitically, turning them into far-right figures. She just thinks feminists would\nbe better off as anti-individualists.\nMy suspicion is that part of what has gone wrong here is that\n\u00adanti-individualist feminists like Hornsby or the Hintikkas do not mean to be\narguing against individualist and Gricean feminists. All of the targets they discuss are mainstream, male philosophers who are not doing anything remotely\nfeminist. However, when individualist and Gricean feminists like Antony and I\nread this work, it\u2019s difficult to bear this in mind: mainstream philosophers were\ndismissing us as not even doing philosophy, so we were horrified to see feminists saying that what we were doing couldn\u2019t be feminist. But this is perhaps\nmisunderstanding their primary target: although they do say that, for example,\ndecompositionalism is at odds with feminism, they are not thinking of feminist\nphilosophers making use of decompositionalism. It\u2019s a mistake to take this to\nbe directed at Gricean feminists, just as it\u2019s a mistake for the Hornsbys and\nHintikkas of the world to fail to see ways that Grice could be used to further\nfeminist causes. Tasneem Alsayyed (Alsayyed 2023) has beautifully analysed\nphenomena like these as what she calls third party hermeneutical impasses, in\nwhich people who should be allies in many ways find it difficult to communicate because they\u2019re each focused on a different opponent. This focus on different opponents leads to systematic misunderstandings.", "location": 27012}
{"paragraph": "Historians like Eileen O\u2019Neill (O\u2019Neill 1997) and Christia Mercer\n(Mercer 2017) have done much to show us the forgotten importance of historical women philosophers, but it nonetheless remains true that the vast\nmajority of canonical philosophy has been written by men. And Antony\u2019s\npoint holds: if one is going to take an etiological approach, one should be\nconsistent about it.More importantly, though, Antony thinks that looking to\nthe demographic origins of ideas or approaches as a way of assessing them\nis misguided. Ideas or approaches should only be evaluated, she argues, by\nexploring their truth or justification. Because of Antony\u2019s naturalism, this\nexamination includes not just philosophical argumentation but also empirical evidence. And one of the things that she finds most frustrating about\netiological attacks on individualism is their apparent lack of interest in such\nevidence. As she notes, individualistic approaches are sometimes dismissed\nas male without a discussion of the reasons that philosophers like Antony\nhave given for holding individualistic views.\nImportantly, Antony argues (in many chapters, across many areas of philosophy) that individualistic approaches hold value for feminists. Once more, I will\nfocus on what she says about philosophy of language. Antony takes up the topic\nof hate speech, arguing that in fact an individualist approach can yield important\nbenefits for feminists. Here she considers a real-life incident in which a southern\nneighbour used the expression \u2018jew down\u2019 (meaning to bargain for a lower price) in\nthe presence of Antony\u2019s Jewish husband. It was clear to her that the neighbour in\nthat moment, but only in that moment, realized just how anti-Jewish that expression was. Her take on the situation is that the expression was always anti-Jewish\nwhether or not a user or audience member picked up on it, and that the neighbour\nacquired an obligation to cease using it once he understood how problematic it was.\nAntony notes that a Gricean theory is particularly well suited to explain the fact that\n\u2018the power of derogatory terms and epithets can be independent of the intentions\u2014\nand knowledge\u2014of people who use them\u2019 (p. 131). A Gricean theory allows us to\nseparately examine how a word functions, what the speaker means, and what an\naudience takes from an utterance\u2014and to look at how these may change over time\nand from context to context. It lets us say that the speaker intended no harm but\nthat he nonetheless used an anti-Jewish expression; and that this may be received\nas a slur by an audience, and do harm, in spite of the speaker\u2019s non-slurring intentions. And it lets us say that the expression may be problematic even in contexts in\nwhich the speaker\u2019s audience is a different one, who finds the expression natural\nand inoffensive. We can do all this precisely because we can separately discuss word\nmeaning, speaker meaning, and audience understanding.\nAll of this is much harder to make sense of on the communicative speech\nact approach that Hornsby favours, on which one cannot pull apart these separate elements, and on which saying something is not possible without uptake.\nAccording to Hornsby, it\u2019s problematically individualistic to look separately\nMind, Vol. XX .

Advice to feminists\nAlong with her polemic, Antony argues that criticisms like Hornsby\u2019s\u2014ones\nwhich rule out entire intellectual approaches as anti-feminist\u2014are immensely\ndamaging. And here, I think, she has things exactly right. What she offers is not\njust a plea to move more slowly and carefully in judging a methodology to be\nanti-feminist, but also an astute analysis of the damage done to other feminists\nby such sweeping dismissals of methodologies:\nMind, Vol. XX .

{"paragraph": "Hornsby and others don\u2019t just argue against individualism on the basis of\nempirical gender difference claims. (Indeed, Hornsby is one of those who\ninsert qualifications, clearly aware that the claims could turn out to be false.)\nAlthough there are many feminist arguments against individualism, Hornsby\u2019s\nother argument is based on a desire for effective feminist analysis and politics. An argument like this, it seems to me, is much more promising than one\nbased on claims about women\u2019s and men\u2019s distinctive modes of thinking. It is\nabsolutely true, and very important, that effective feminist thought and action\nrequire an understanding of the ways that structures and institutions work. A\nfeminism which focuses exclusively on individuals will be extremely limited in\nwhat it can understand and what it can accomplish. It is, then, perfectly reasonable to insist that feminists cannot afford to limit their theorizing to understanding individuals.\nBut some feminist arguments against individualism\u2014especially those of\nthe past\u2014took these considerations to establish much more. Perhaps because\nthere was already an air of suspicion about thinking in terms of individuals,\nsome feminists of the 1990s and early 2000s argued that feminists should reject\nany theorizing that involves individuals. Hornsby\u2018s rejection of the work of H.P.\nGrice, and of \u2018decompositionalism\u2019 seems to Antony to be of this sort. The problem with Grice\u2019s theory, according to Hornsby, seems to be that it discusses\nwhat the speaker intends to convey, and what the audience understands. This\nis said to be decompositionalist and individualistic in its separation of speaker\nMind, Vol. XX . XX . XX 2024\b", "location": 13664}

{"paragraph": "4. Polemic\nAntony herself makes note of her sometimes polemical tone, describing her paper\n\u2018Is There a \u201cFeminist\u201d Philosophy of Language?\u2019 as \u2018a polemical paper, thinly disguised as a methodological paper\u2019 (p. 101). Indeed, this is some of what I found so\nhelpfully heartening as I felt myself being attacked by other feminists when they\ndiscussed such things as reference or Grice. In one place\u2014addressing Hornsby\u2019s\nopposition to \u2018decompositionalist\u2019 discussions of speaker and audience perspectives, she writes, \u2018Hornsby appears to be suggesting that one cannot hold the philosophical view that communication is relational without turning into Ayn Rand\u2019\n(p. 111). I confess that I laughed out loud, and also that I shared her frustration\nwith what she consistently reads as Hornsby\u2019s dismissal of all semantic theories as\nunacceptably \u2018malestream\u2019 philosophy of language.\nBut then I revisited Hornsby\u2019s paper. And it bears noting that in the very\nfirst substantive section of the paper, Hornsby writes, \u2018Some feminist writers\nin consequence have been hostile to the very idea of a semantic theory. Such\nhostility seems to me misplaced\u2019 (p. 88). It cannot be right, then, to say that\nHornsby herself rejects all semantic theory as unacceptably malestream. So\nsomething has, after all, gone wrong in Antony\u2019s reading of Hornsby.\nOn the other hand, it is difficult to see how Hornsby\u2019s version of semantic\ntheory can work. In one puzzling passage, she writes:\nWhen the account I have offered is brought to bear, the suggestion must\nbe that where a semantic theory tells one that a sentence s means that p,\nutterances of s are seen as fit for use to say that p to someone, and that an\nutterance is fit for such use only where a fellow language user\u2019s taking it to be\nso used could suffice for a speaker who uses it having said that p(pp. 95-6,\nemphases added).\nThe sufficiency claim here is a shocking one, which seems to leave semantic content entirely up to the audience. In a further passage she writes, \u2018No\nlinguistic meaning without saying, and no saying without communication\u2019\n(p. 96). Hornsby does suggest in a footnote (pp. 103-4) that we may sometimes\nwant to capture the idea of a speaker saying something without succeeding in\ngetting uptake. But she suggests that this would be a different conception of\nsaying from what she has in mind as she argues for communicative speech acts.\nIf that\u2019s right, then what she\u2019s talking about here seems to leave no room for\nMind, Vol. XX .

{"paragraph": "Although my focus in this review has been on a particular dispute and its historical\ncontext, the lessons really are much broader and more enduring. A few years ago, a\ncontemporary of mine told me he had assumed back in graduate school that I was\nright-wing, because I was a direct reference theorist. I have had feminist philosophers tell me that other feminists have dismissed their work as not feminist because\nthey are doing analytic metaphysics or harbouring a fondness for Descartes. I have,\neven in recent years, witnessed serious hostility among left-wing philosophers to\nthe very idea of using Grice or the notion of reference in anti-oppressive philosophy\nof language. None of these theoretical approaches rule out valuable feminist work.\nAntony is right to insist that feminist philosophers should be happy to accept valuable resources for doing feminist philosophy, even if those resources come from\nsurprising places. Her work has done much to make feminist philosophy the pluralistic place that it now is. But her message still needs to be heard and remembered:\nwe should stop using \u2018feminist\u2019 as a bludgeon.\nIn this review, I have focused narrowly, but in a way that I hope illuminates Antony\u2019s approach and its enormous value to feminist philosophy. Only\nNatural collects together papers that have played a vital role in the development\nof one of the most vibrant areas of philosophy today.

{"paragraph": "As I\u2019ve noted, there wasn\u2019t much feminist analytic philosophy in the 1980s\nand 1990s. Moreover, much that did exist was strongly influenced by Carol\nGilligan\u2019s In a Different Voice, which outlined what Gilligan saw as a neglected\nvoice in moral thinking, one she tentatively suggested to be more characteristic\nof girls and women (Gilligan 1983). Although she said that she was not claiming that men and boys think differently from women and girls, she nonetheless\nfell frequently into gendered language in describing this voice, and was widely\ntaken to have made an empirical claim of gender difference. In the literature\nthat flowed from Gilligan\u2019s work, women were described as focused on emotion\nand connection; while men were described as focused on reason and individualism. These ideas were especially influential among early feminist ethicists\u2014\nno surprise, since Gilligan\u2019s focus had been on moral thinking. However, they\nwere also taken up in other areas. It became very fashionable for feminist philosophers to criticize reason, individualism, and generality\u2014and to base these\ncriticisms in the idea that these were male ways of approaching the world. An\nimportant task of feminist philosophy, according to this line of thought, was\nto develop new theories based on women\u2019s ways of thinking to replace the old\nones that had been based on men\u2019s.\nIt is important to note that these claims are very different from the superficially similar ones of Feminist Standpoint theorists. According to standpoint\nepistemologies (which have their root in Marxism), what one is in a position to\nknow depends in part on one\u2019s social location. People who occupy marginalised\nsocial locations are epistemically privileged with respect to knowing certain\nsorts of things\u2014they will find it easier to come to know these things (though\nimportantly this knowledge will not be automatic). The superficial similarity\nbetween the Different Voice hypothesis and Feminist Standpoint Theory is that\nMind, Vol. XX . XX . XX 2024\b", "location": 6268}

This unanalysability is crucial to Hornsby\u2019s\nunderstanding\u2014and it\u2019s a key way that the approach is anti-individualistic: it\nrejects looking at the perspectives of individual speakers and audiences, insisting that we should look only at the speech act as a whole.", "location": 12928}

{"paragraph": "and audience perspectives. Hornsby\u2019s approach would instead take communication as not analysable into speaker and audience perspectives.\nAs an example of what her preferred approach can do, Hornsby considers the case of hate speech. A common dismissive response to efforts to\nrestrict hate speech is to place the blame for any harm that comes from it\nonto the audiences. On this line of thought, it is because of the way that the\naudiences take the hate speech that it harms them. If they could develop\ngreater resilience or a sense of humour, there would be no harm. Hornsby\nrightly points out that this response involves separating the speech from\nthe audience\u2019s reaction and treating the audience\u2019s reaction as something\nwhich could be changed. Hornsby\u2019s preferred approach makes this move\nimpossible. On her communicative speech act story, the speech act of saying something hateful is not separable from its uptake. So there is no room\nto pull apart the utterance from the audience\u2018s response and suggest that\nthe audience should simply shift what they\u2019re doing. Hornsby takes this to\nmuch better capture the reality and harm of hate speech, and to therefore\nmake room for taking a properly serious approach to this important topic.", "location": 18305}
{"paragraph": "both hold that gendered social locations matter cognitively. Different Voice\ntheorists suggest that women and men think differently; while Standpoint theorists suggest that women may be better situated to know certain things than\nmen are. Importantly, however, Standpoint theorists are not in general committed to the idea of different cognitive styles in the way that Different Voice\ntheorists are. Instead, their focus is on the kinds of things that one may find it\neasier or harder to learn about\u2014those in positions of oppression, for example,\ncome to know things about the workings of oppression that those in positions\nof domination don\u2019t. Standpoint theorists might agree with Different Voice\ntheorists that women are better at discussing emotion, but they\u2019ll differ about\nwhy: Different Voice theorists will say that women are more guided by emotion\nthan by reason, while Standpoint theorists will point instead to women\u2019s much\ngreater experience of doing emotional labour\u2014and the conceptual resources\nthat they develop through doing this labour. Importantly, Standpoint theorists\nwould not in general characterise reason as male\u2014while Different Voice theorists would.\nThe idea that women philosophers could create an entirely new form of\nphilosophy because they approach the subject differently\u2014through emotion\nand connection\u2014seemed to many immensely exciting. It took hold not just in\nethics, but also in other areas. Good feminists, this line of thought went, should\nembrace women\u2019s thinking and reject men\u2019s thinking. A good feminist, then,\nshould draw from emotion rather than reason, and should focus on connection\nrather than individuals. And she should do this because that\u2019s what women do.\n(I\u2019ll get to better reasons in the next section.)\nThis led to feminists arguing, across many areas of philosophy, that a focus\non individuals was male\u2014or, as some more cautiously put it\u2014associated with\nmaleness, and therefore problematic for feminists. Feminists should, according\nto this view, embrace women\u2019s thinking by adopting a focus on connectedness.\nTake, for example, my own area of philosophy of language. This line of\nthought is what led to Hintikka and Hintikka\u2019s argument that a focus on reference was male. And it also led Jennifer Hornsby\u2014in an article that Antony\nwrote about in \u2018Is There a Feminist Philosophy of Language?\u2019\u2014 to argue against\nthe individualism of what Hornsby (and others) called \u2018malestream\u2019 philosophy\nof language. These male ways of thinking include what Hornsby calls \u2018decompositionalist\u2019 thinking. According to such thinking, \u2018the attribution of a piece of\nlinguistic communication between two people is\u2026equivalent to the conjunction of something purely speaker-related with something purely hearer-related\u2019\n(p. 93). Hornsby claims such thinking pervades analytic philosophy wherever\n\u2018necessary and sufficient conditions\u2019 for the applications of concepts are sought\n(p. 93).

{"paragraph": "All of us who have chosen to make a career out of philosophy have been\ndrawn to the subject because of some problem that bothered us, some dialectic that engaged us, or some thinker who moved us. To this extent, we\nfelt ourselves at home in philosophy. But as women in a male-dominated\nfield, we have also experienced isolation, alienation, rejection, or all of\nthese, and many of us have looked to a community of feminist philosophers\u2014partly actual, partly imagined\u2014for relief. In circumstances such as\nthese, many of us will of course try to unify our philosophical and political\nstandpoints. My plea is that we do this constructively, by finding whatever\nmatches we can between the theoretical questions generated by our politics and the intellectual resources supplied by our philosophies.

At\nmany points across the decades, Antony was a nearly lone dissenting voice: her\nwillingness to disagree helped to make feminist philosophy into the flourishing,\ndeeply pluralist area that it is today. Explaining some of this history will, I hope, help\nto contextualise the sometimes-heated early debates for readers who may be less\nfamiliar with them.

{"paragraph": "Only Natural: Gender, Knowledge, and Humankind, by Louise Antony. NY:\nOxford University Press, 2022. Pp. xvi + 432.\nLouise Antony is a towering figure, one of the founders of analytic feminism.\nHer collected papers show the breadth of her scholarship, brilliance, and influence\u2014across philosophy of mind, epistemology, philosophy of psychology,\nphilosophy of language, and even ethics. In all these areas, Antony applies a\ncarefully honed feminist lens, developed through not just academic work but\ndecades of feminist activism.\nIn some books, a philosopher\u2019s character comes through very clearly, and\nin this book of collected papers (from the acknowledgements onward) it could\nnot be clearer how deeply Antony treasures her many decades of passionate\ndisagreement with other feminist philosophers. An important strand of this has\nbeen her ardent defence of individualism, beginning with the classic (and brilliantly titled) \u2018Sisters, Please, I\u2019d Rather Do it Myself \u2019, going deeply against the\ngrain of most feminist thought to defend individualism in feminist epistemology. Another strand, equally antithetical to many feminist philosophers, has\nbeen her arguments defending the idea of human nature, and even cognitive\nnativism. Here her focus has been on showing that one can, for example, accept\nthe idea of humans as having evolved a universal grammar\u2014while nonetheless rejecting the many deeply sexist uses of human nature and evolutionary\npsychology that feminists have rightly railed against. An especially important\npaper in this vein is her \u2018\u201cHuman Nature\u201d and its Role in Feminist Theory\u2019.\nThis is intimately related to Antony\u2019s long-standing defence of naturalism in\nphilosophy, beginning with her brilliant \u2018Quine as Feminist\u2019. Indeed, another\ndistinctive feature of her work is her careful engagement with empirical literature. There is nowhere that this shines through so clearly as in her wonderful\n\u2018Different Voices or Perfect Storm\u2019, one the most important papers written on\nthe underrepresentation of women in philosophy. This is a tightly argued critical response to some of the theories that have been put forward to explain this\nunderrepresentation, but it also puts forward its own very compelling \u2018perfect\nstorm\u2019 model. Whether or not you agree with Antony, you will benefit from\nreading and engaging deeply with this book\u2014and these articles are, for me,\nparticular high points.\nYet I\u2019m going to focus on a different chapter, \u2018Is There a Feminist Philosophy\nof Language?\u2019, which has not been so widely engaged with.
