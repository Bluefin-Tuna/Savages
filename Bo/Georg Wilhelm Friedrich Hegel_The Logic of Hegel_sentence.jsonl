{"sentence": "Now, although this relation does undoubtedly belong to necessity, it forms only one aspect in the process of that category.", "location": 586374}
{"sentence": "To determine which of these aspects is more essential than another, again, requires a further syllogism of this kind, which fixing on the single quality can with equal ease discover in it some aspect or consideration by which it can make good its claims to be considered necessary and important.", "location": 667353}
{"sentence": "In this lies its formalism.", "location": 475761}
{"sentence": "In this category of general agreement there was latent the deep-rooted perception, which does not escape even the least cultivated mind, that the consciousness of the individual is at the same time particular and accidental.", "location": 293358}
{"sentence": "Instead of being rich and full above all measure, it is so narrowly conceived that it is, on the contrary, extremely poor and altogether empty.", "location": 176527}
{"sentence": "The so-called atheism of Spinoza is merely an exaggeration of the fact that he defrauds the principle of difference or finitude of its due.", "location": 580543}
{"sentence": "In its immediate form it is the relationship of Substance and Accident.", "location": 576952}
{"sentence": "*       *       *       *       *  The passage from chemism to the teleological relation is implied in the mutual cancelling of both of the forms of the chemical process.", "location": 714558}
{"sentence": "1-126 (of which 12 pp.", "location": 14433}
{"sentence": "The special meaning which these superficial thoughts of more imperfect and more perfect have in this place is to indicate the distinction of being, as an immediate unity with itself, from the notion, as free mediation with itself.", "location": 597956}
{"sentence": "What really takes place here is that the immediacy, which still attaches to measure as such, is set aside.", "location": 435579}
{"sentence": "It derived its materials from earlier philosophers, particularly the Schoolmen.", "location": 179751}
{"sentence": "Man must, as it were, take possession of his body, so that it may be the instrument of his soul.", "location": 726657}
{"sentence": "The object, however, has also difference attaching to it: it falls into pieces, indefinite in their multiplicity (making an objective world); and each of these individualised parts is also an object, an intrinsically concrete, complete, and independent existence.", "location": 688000}
{"sentence": "It means rather that the Idea which forms the common content of nature and mind, is found in nature as outward only, and for that very reason only inward.", "location": 535020}
{"sentence": "All things, we say,--that is, the finite world as such,--are doomed; and in saying so, we have a vision of Dialectic as the universal and irresistible power before which nothing can stay, however secure and stable it may deem itself.", "location": 323939}
{"sentence": "It may be called reason (and this is the proper philosophical signification of reason); subject-object; the unity of the ideal and the real, of the finite and the infinite, of soul and body; the possibility which has its actuality in its own self; that of which the nature can be thought only as existent, &c. All these descriptions apply, because the Idea contains all the relations of understanding, but contains them in their infinite self-return and self-identity.", "location": 737700}
{"sentence": "This gives the second figure of the syllogism, (2) U--I--P. It expresses the truth of the first; it shows in other words that the intermediation has taken place in the individual, and is thus something contingent.", "location": 670045}
{"sentence": "Had such people only once regularly asked themselves how they came to think the _merely_ possible or contingent (the not-necessary), and how they actually do so!", "location": 870462}
{"sentence": "Accordingly God, when He is defined to be the sum of all realities, the most real of beings, turns into a _mere abstract._ And the only term under which that most real of real, things can be defined is that of Being--itself the height of abstraction.", "location": 232172}
{"sentence": "This is that action of thought, which will hereafter be specially considered under the name of Dialectic, and regarding which we need only at the outset observe that, instead of being brought to bear upon the categories from without, it is immanent in their own action.", "location": 197452}
{"sentence": "We may seek to rob men's great actions of their grandeur, by the insinuation of hypocrisy; but, though it is possible that men in an instance now and then may dissemble and disguise a good deal, they cannot conceal the whole of their inner self, which infallibly betrays itself in the _decursus vitae._ Even here it is true that a man is nothing but the series of his actions.", "location": 539503}
{"sentence": "In Goethe's more reflective prose we see illustrations of this usage: _e.g.", "location": 828739}
{"sentence": "Such however is not the proper or primary tendency of Sophistry: the standpoint of which is no other than that of 'Raisonnement.'", "location": 482551}
{"sentence": "This illustration will show how a limit or imperfection in knowledge comes to be termed a limit or imperfection, only when it is compared with the actually-present Idea of the universal, of a total and perfect.", "location": 260595}
{"sentence": "Besides having, a particular and subjective character clinging to them, and thus leaving room for great variety of interpretation, they themselves first of all require a firm and fast definition by thought.", "location": 158665}
{"sentence": "Everything is thus put outside of every other.", "location": 470336}
{"sentence": "(\u03b3) The Inward (Interior) is the ground, when it stands as the mere form of the one side of the Appearance and the Correlation,--the empty form of reflection-into-self.", "location": 531355}
{"sentence": "It will be shown in the Logic that thought (and the universal) is not a mere opposite of sense: it lets nothing escape it, but, outflanking its other, is at once that other and itself.", "location": 102527}
{"sentence": "Or, if we reject reality, as implying a reflection, we get a more immediate or unreflected statement of the same thing, when Jacobi says that the God of Spinoza is the _principium_ of being in all existence.", "location": 341355}
{"sentence": "It may happen, however, that empirical is an epithet applicable only to the form of scientific exposition; whilst intuitive sagacity has arranged what are mere phenomena, according to the essential sequence of the notion.", "location": 79913}
{"sentence": "The preface begins by alluding to several criticisms on his philosophy,--'which for the most part have shown little vocation for the business'--and to his discussion of them in the _Jahrb\u00fccher_ of 1829 (_Vermischte Schriften,_ ii.", "location": 29569}
{"sentence": "And this is the true business of logic: to show that those thoughts, which as usually employed merely float before consciousness neither understood nor demonstrated, are really grades in the self-determination of thought.", "location": 477771}
{"sentence": "The individual by itself does not correspond to its notion.", "location": 733381}
{"sentence": "The End is consequently finite, and that partly in its content, partly in the circumstance that it has an external condition in the object, which has to be found existing, and which is taken as material for its realisation.", "location": 720106}

{"sentence": "A substantial distinction is in these cases secretly substituted for the empty distinction of Being and Nought.", "location": 352956}
{"sentence": "The Void, which is assumed as the complementary principle to the atoms, is repulsion and nothing else, presented under the image of the nothing existing between the atoms.--Modern Atomism--and physics is still in principle atomistic--has surrendered the atoms so far as to pin its faith on molecules or particles.", "location": 389045}
{"sentence": "And to this extent the essence is not abstract reflection into self, but into an other.", "location": 474756}
{"sentence": "If the notion were put at the head of Logic, and defined, quite correctly in point of content, as the unity of Being and Essence, the following question would come up: What are we to think under the terms 'Being' and 'Essence,' and how do they come to be embraced in the unity of the Notion?", "location": 601153}
{"sentence": "It is certainly not on the finite ground occupied by these sciences that we can expect to meet the in-dwelling presence of the infinite.", "location": 272197}

{"sentence": "Thus arise these four new propositions: _(a)_ the Soul is a substance: _(b)_ it is a simple substance: _(c)_ it is numerically identical at the various periods of existence: _(d)_ it stands in relation to space.", "location": 219819}
{"sentence": "Yet, on further examination even this relation will appear finite, and finite in virtue of this mediation: just as, conversely, the relation of whole and parts is obviously finite in virtue of its immediacy.", "location": 524430}
{"sentence": "The reason, which at first exists in the child only as an inner possibility, is actualised through education: and conversely, the child by these means becomes conscious that the goodness, religion, and science which he had at first looked upon as an outward authority, are his own and inward nature.", "location": 536804}
{"sentence": "In earlier writings Jacobi had insisted on the contrast between the superior authority of feeling and faith (which are in touch with truth) and the mechanical method of intelligence and reasoning (Verstand and Vernunft).", "location": 829759}

{"sentence": "This self-sameness is at the same time, as absolute form, the activity which reduces into dependency and mediates into immediacy.--Whatever is necessary is through an other, which is broken up into the mediating ground (the Fact and the Activity) and an immediate actuality or accidental circumstance, which is at the same time a Condition.", "location": 575744}

{"sentence": "But if to have no notion merely means that we cannot represent in imagination the oneness of Being and Nought, the statement is far from being true; for every one has countless ways of envisaging this unity.", "location": 354809}
{"sentence": "When the record adds that God drove men out of the Garden of Eden to prevent their eating of the tree of life, it only means that on his natural side certainly man is finite and mortal, but in knowledge infinite.", "location": 142058}
{"sentence": "It was therefore a chief concern of this study to lay down what were called general Cosmological laws: for instance, that Nature does not act by fits and starts.", "location": 168892}
{"sentence": "For when we do so, we separate them from substance, and from the mode in which they flow from eternity, without which they cannot be properly understood.'", "location": 865724}

{"sentence": "This first happens when man knows that he is 'I.'", "location": 122843}
{"sentence": "As the idea is (a) a process, it follows that such an expression for the Absolute as _unity_ of thought and being, of finite and infinite, &c. is false; for unity expresses an abstract and merely quiescent identity.", "location": 742489}
{"sentence": "All that was meant by the phrase was that mathematics has not to do with notions, but with abstract qualities of sense-perceptions.", "location": 765925}
{"sentence": "This observation with regard to the nature of mathematics gives a hint as to the first and supreme condition of its possibility: it must be based on some pure percept in which it can exhibit all its concepts _in concreto_ and yet _\u00e0 priori,_ or, as it is called, _construe_ them.'", "location": 900759}
{"sentence": "That necessitates a higher estimate of the notion, however, than is found in formal conceptualist Logic, where the notion is a mere form of our subjective thought, with no original content of its own.", "location": 604560}
{"sentence": "In so far as in Measure quality and quantity are only in _immediate_ unity, to that extent their difference presents itself in a manner equally immediate.", "location": 429843}
{"sentence": "As _soul,_ the notion is realised in a body of whose externality the soul is the immediate self-relating universality.", "location": 744225}
{"sentence": "In common life, any freak of fancy, any error, evil and everything of the nature of evil, as well as every degenerate and transitory existence whatever, gets in a casual way the name of actuality.", "location": 50865}

{"sentence": "But in its true and proper character.", "location": 317910}
{"sentence": "That however is far from meaning that the contingent belongs to our subjective conception alone, and must therefore be simply set aside, if we wish to get at the truth.", "location": 559607}

{"sentence": "People who are too fastidious towards the finite never reach actuality, but linger lost in abstraction, and their light dies away.", "location": 370115}
{"sentence": "And to understand the relation of action and reaction we must not let the two sides rest in their state of mere given facts, but recognise them, as has been shown in the two paragraphs preceding, for factors of a third and higher, which is the notion and nothing else.", "location": 593096}

{"sentence": "But in general even here the essential unity between inward and outward is maintained.", "location": 537865}
{"sentence": "This 'realisation' of the notion,--a realisation in which the universal is this one totality withdrawn back into itself (of which the different members are no less the whole, and) which has given itself a character of 'immediate' unity by merging the mediation:--this realisation of the notion is the Object.", "location": 686368}
{"sentence": "In this way life is essentially something alive, and in point of its immediacy this individual living thing.", "location": 744986}

{"sentence": "Or, if we reflect that the finite, when identified with the infinite, certainly cannot remain what it was out of such unity, and will at least suffer some change in its characteristics--as an alkali, when combined with an acid, loses some of its properties, we must see that, the same fate awaits the infinite, which, as the negative, will on its part likewise have its edge, as it were, taken off on the other.", "location": 380580}

{"sentence": "Natural plain Empiricism, though it unquestionably insists most upon sensuous perception, still allows a super-sensible world or spiritual reality, whatever may be its structure and constitution, and whether derived from intellect, or from imagination, &c.

{"sentence": "In an aggregate like this, the several branches of knowledge owe their place in the encyclopaedia to extrinsic reasons, and their unity is therefore artificial: they are _arranged,_ but we cannot say they form a _system._ For the same reason, especially as the materials to be combined also depend upon no one rule or principle, the arrangement is at best an experiment, and will always exhibit inequalities.", "location": 76808}
