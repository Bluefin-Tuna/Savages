"Title: The Birth of Tragedy; or, Hellenism and Pessimism"
"Author: Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche"
{"paragraph": "Thus Euripides as a poet echoes above all his own conscious\nknowledge; and it is precisely on this account that he occupies such\na notable position in the history of Greek art. With reference to his\ncritico-productive activity, he must often have felt that he ought\nto actualise in the drama the words at the beginning of the essay of\nAnaxagoras: \"In the beginning all things were mixed together; then\ncame the understanding and created order.\" And if Anaxagoras with his\n\"\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe1\u03c2\" seemed like the first sober person among nothing but drunken\nphilosophers, Euripides may also have conceived his relation to\nthe other tragic poets under a similar figure. As long as the sole\nruler and disposer of the universe, the \u03bd\u03bf\u1fe1\u03c2, was still excluded\nfrom artistic activity, things were all mixed together in a chaotic,\nprimitive mess;--it is thus Euripides was obliged to think, it is thus\nhe was obliged to condemn the \"drunken\" poets as the first \"sober\" one\namong them. What Sophocles said of \u00c6schylus, that he did what was\nright, though unconsciously, was surely not in the mind of Euripides:\nwho would have admitted only thus much, that \u00c6schylus, _because_ he\nwrought unconsciously, did what was wrong. So also the divine Plato\nspeaks for the most part only ironically of the creative faculty of the\npoet, in so far as it is not conscious insight, and places it on a par\nwith the gift of the soothsayer and dream-interpreter; insinuating that\nthe poet is incapable of composing until he has become unconscious and\nreason has deserted him. Like Plato, Euripides undertook to show to the\nworld the reverse of the \"unintelligent\" poet; his \u00e6sthetic principle\nthat \"to be beautiful everything must be known\" is, as I have said,\nthe parallel to the Socratic \"to be good everything must be known.\"\nAccordingly we may regard Euripides as the poet of \u00e6sthetic Socratism.\nSocrates, however, was that _second spectator_ who did not comprehend\nand therefore did not esteem the Old Tragedy; in alliance with him\nEuripides ventured to be the herald of a new artistic activity. If,\nthen, the Old Tragedy was here destroyed, it follows that \u00e6sthetic\nSocratism was the murderous principle; but in so far as the struggle is\ndirected against the Dionysian element in the old art, we recognise in\nSocrates the opponent of Dionysus, the new Orpheus who rebels against\nDionysus; and although destined to be torn to pieces by the M\u00e6nads of\nthe Athenian court, yet puts to flight the overpowerful god himself,\nwho, when he fled from Lycurgus, the king of Edoni, sought refuge in\nthe depths of the ocean--namely, in the mystical flood of a secret\ncult which gradually overspread the earth.", "location": 182687}

Creation felt and explained as an instinct\nwould be merely the unremitting inventive action of a dissatisfied\nbeing, overflowing with wealth and living at high tension and high\npressure,--of a God who would overcome the sorrows of existence by\nmeans only of continual changes and transformations,--appearance as a\ntransient and momentary deliverance; the world as an apparent sequence\nof godlike visions and deliverances.", "location": 30902}

{"paragraph": "With the pre-established harmony which obtains between perfect drama\nand its music, the drama attains the highest degree of conspicuousness,\nsuch as is usually unattainable in mere spoken drama. As all the\nanimated figures of the scene in the independently evolved lines\nof melody simplify themselves before us to the distinctness of the\ncatenary curve, the coexistence of these lines is also audible in the\nharmonic change which sympathises in a most delicate manner with the\nevolved process: through which change the relations of things become\nimmediately perceptible to us in a sensible and not at all abstract\nmanner, as we likewise perceive thereby that it is only in these\nrelations that the essence of a character and of a line of melody\nmanifests itself clearly. And while music thus compels us to see more\nextensively and more intrinsically than usual, and makes us spread out\nthe curtain of the scene before ourselves like some delicate texture,\nthe world of the stage is as infinitely expanded for our spiritualised,\nintrospective eye as it is illumined outwardly from within. How can\nthe word-poet furnish anything analogous, who strives to attain this\ninternal expansion and illumination of the visible stage-world by a\nmuch more imperfect mechanism and an indirect path, proceeding as he\ndoes from word and concept? Albeit musical tragedy likewise avails\nitself of the word, it is at the same time able to place alongside\nthereof its basis and source, and can make the unfolding of the word,\nfrom within outwards, obvious to us.", "location": 282409}
{"paragraph": "Let us recollect furthermore how Kant and Schopenhauer made it\npossible for the spirit of _German philosophy_ streaming from the\nsame sources to annihilate the satisfied delight in existence of\nscientific Socratism by the delimitation of the boundaries thereof; how\nthrough this delimitation an infinitely profounder and more serious\nview of ethical problems and of art was inaugurated, which we may\nunhesitatingly designate as _Dionysian_ wisdom comprised in concepts.\nTo what then does the mystery of this oneness of German music and\nphilosophy point, if not to a new form of existence, concerning the\nsubstance of which we can only inform ourselves presentiently from\nHellenic analogies? For to us who stand on the boundary line between\ntwo different forms of existence, the Hellenic prototype retains the\nimmeasurable value, that therein all these transitions and struggles\nare imprinted in a classically instructive form: except that we, as\nit were, experience analogically in _reverse_ order the chief epochs\nof the Hellenic genius, and seem now, for instance, to pass backwards\nfrom the Alexandrine age to the period of tragedy. At the same time\nwe have the feeling that the birth of a tragic age betokens only a\nreturn to itself of the German spirit, a blessed self-rediscovering\nafter excessive and urgent external influences have for a long time\ncompelled it, living as it did in helpless barbaric formlessness, to\nservitude under their form. It may at last, after returning to the\nprimitive source of its being, venture to stalk along boldly and freely\nbefore all nations without hugging the leading-strings of a Romanic\ncivilisation: if only it can learn implicitly of one people--the\nGreeks, of whom to learn at all is itself a high honour and a rare\ndistinction. And when did we require these highest of all teachers more\nthan at present, when we experience _a re-birth of tragedy_ and are in\ndanger alike of not knowing whence it comes, and of being unable to\nmake clear to ourselves whither it tends.", "location": 263703}

{"paragraph": "Our father's family was also in fairly comfortable circumstances,\nand likewise very large. Our grandfather Dr. Nietzsche (D.D. and\nSuperintendent) married twice, and had in all twelve children, of whom\nthree died young. Our grandfather on this side, whom I never knew,\nmust certainly have been a distinguished, dignified, very learned\nand reserved man; his second wife--our beloved grandmother--was an\nactive-minded, intelligent, and exceptionally good-natured woman.\nThe whole of our father's family, which I only got to know when they\nwere very advanced in years, were remarkable for their great power of\nself-control, their lively interest in intellectual matters, and a\nstrong sense of family unity, which manifested itself both in their\nsplendid readiness to help one another and in their very excellent\nrelations with each other. Our father was the youngest son, and, thanks\nto his uncommonly lovable disposition, together with other gifts, which\nonly tended to become more marked as he grew older, he was quite the\nfavourite of the family. Blessed with a thoroughly sound constitution,\nas all averred who knew him at the convent-school in Rossleben, at\nthe University, or later at the ducal court of Altenburg, he was tall\nand slender, possessed an undoubted gift for poetry and real musical\ntalent, and was moreover a man of delicate sensibilities, full of\nconsideration for his whole family, and distinguished in his manners.", "location": 5705}

{"paragraph": "Frederick Nietzsche was born at R\u00f6cken near L\u00fctzen, in the Prussian\nprovince of Saxony, on the 15th of October 1844, at 10 a.m. The day\nhappened to be the anniversary of the birth of Frederick-William IV.,\nthen King of Prussia, and the peal of the local church-bells which was\nintended to celebrate this event, was, by a happy coincidence, just\ntimed to greet my brother on his entrance into the world. In 1841,\nat the time when our father was tutor to the Altenburg Princesses,\nTheresa of Saxe-Altenburg, Elizabeth, Grand Duchess of Olden-burg, and\nAlexandra, Grand Duchess Constantine of Russia, he had had the honour\nof being presented to his witty and pious sovereign. The meeting seems\nto have impressed both parties very favourably; for, very shortly\nafter it had taken place, our father received his living at R\u00f6cken \"by\nsupreme command.\" His joy may well be imagined, therefore, when a first\nson was born to him on his beloved and august patron's birthday, and\nat the christening ceremony he spoke as follows:--\"Thou blessed month\nof October!--for many years the most decisive events in my life have\noccurred within thy thirty-one days, and now I celebrate the greatest\nand most glorious of them all by baptising my little boy! O blissful\nmoment! O exquisite festival! O unspeakably holy duty! In the Lord's\nname I bless thee!--With all my heart I utter these words: Bring me\nthis, my beloved child, that I may consecrate it unto the Lord. My son,\nFrederick William, thus shalt thou be named on earth, as a memento of\nmy royal benefactor on whose birthday thou wast born!\"", "location": 1574}
{"paragraph": "Our whole modern world is entangled in the meshes of Alexandrine\nculture, and recognises as its ideal the _theorist_ equipped with\nthe most potent means of knowledge, and labouring in the service of\nscience, of whom the archetype and progenitor is Socrates. All our\neducational methods have originally this ideal in view: every other\nform of existence must struggle onwards wearisomely beside it, as\nsomething tolerated, but not intended. In an almost alarming manner the\ncultured man was here found for a long time only in the form of the\nscholar: even our poetical arts have been forced to evolve from learned\nimitations, and in the main effect of the rhyme we still recognise the\norigin of our poetic form from artistic experiments with a non-native\nand thoroughly learned language. How unintelligible must _Faust,_ the\nmodern cultured man, who is in himself intelligible, have appeared to a\ntrue Greek,--Faust, storming discontentedly through all the faculties,\ndevoted to magic and the devil from a desire for knowledge, whom we\nhave only to place alongside of Socrates for the purpose of comparison,\nin order to see that modern man begins to divine the boundaries of\nthis Socratic love of perception and longs for a coast in the wide\nwaste of the ocean of knowledge. When Goethe on one occasion said to\nEckermann with reference to Napoleon: \"Yes, my good friend, there is\nalso a productiveness of deeds,\" he reminded us in a charmingly na\u00efve\nmanner that the non-theorist is something incredible and astounding to\nmodern man; so that the wisdom of Goethe is needed once more in order\nto discover that such a surprising form of existence is comprehensible,\nnay even pardonable.", "location": 239966}
{"paragraph": "The most sorrowful figure of the Greek stage, the hapless _\u0152dipus,_\nwas understood by Sophocles as the noble man, who in spite of his\nwisdom was destined to error and misery, but nevertheless through\nhis extraordinary sufferings ultimately exerted a magical, wholesome\ninfluence on all around him, which continues effective even after\nhis death. The noble man does not sin; this is what the thoughtful\npoet wishes to tell us: all laws, all natural order, yea, the moral\nworld itself, may be destroyed through his action, but through this\nvery action a higher magic circle of influences is brought into play,\nwhich establish a new world on the ruins of the old that has been\noverthrown. This is what the poet, in so far as he is at the same time\na religious thinker, wishes to tell us: as poet, he shows us first of\nall a wonderfully complicated legal mystery, which the judge slowly\nunravels, link by link, to his own destruction. The truly Hellenic\ndelight at this dialectical loosening is so great, that a touch of\nsurpassing cheerfulness is thereby communicated to the entire play,\nwhich everywhere blunts the edge of the horrible presuppositions of the\nprocedure. In the \"\u0152dipus at Colonus\" we find the same cheerfulness,\nelevated, however, to an infinite transfiguration: in contrast to\nthe aged king, subjected to an excess of misery, and exposed solely\nas a _sufferer_ to all that befalls him, we have here a supermundane\ncheerfulness, which descends from a divine sphere and intimates to\nus that in his purely passive attitude the hero attains his highest\nactivity, the influence of which extends far beyond his life, while\nhis earlier conscious musing and striving led him only to passivity.\nThus, then, the legal knot of the fable of \u0152dipus, which to mortal\neyes appears indissolubly entangled, is slowly unravelled--and the\nprofoundest human joy comes upon us in the presence of this divine\ncounterpart of dialectics. If this explanation does justice to the\npoet, it may still be asked whether the substance of the myth is\nthereby exhausted; and here it turns out that the entire conception\nof the poet is nothing but the light-picture which healing nature\nholds up to us after a glance into the abyss. \u0152dipus, the murderer of\nhis father, the husband of his mother, \u0152dipus, the interpreter of the\nriddle of the Sphinx! What does the mysterious triad of these deeds\nof destiny tell us? There is a primitive popular belief, especially\nin Persia, that a wise Magian can be born only of incest: which\nwe have forthwith to interpret to ourselves with reference to the\nriddle-solving and mother-marrying \u0152dipus, to the effect that when\nthe boundary of the present and future, the rigid law of individuation\nand, in general, the intrinsic spell of nature, are broken by prophetic\nand magical powers, an extraordinary counter-naturalness--as, in this\ncase, incest--must have preceded as a cause; for how else could one\nforce nature to surrender her secrets but by victoriously opposing her,\n_i.e.,_ by means of the Unnatural? It is this intuition which I see\nimprinted in the awful triad of the destiny of \u0152dipus: the very man\nwho solves the riddle of nature--that double-constituted Sphinx--must\nalso, as the murderer of his father and husband of his mother, break\nthe holiest laws of nature. Indeed, it seems as if the myth sought to\nwhisper into our ears that wisdom, especially Dionysian wisdom, is\nan unnatural abomination, and that whoever, through his knowledge,\nplunges nature into an abyss of annihilation, must also experience\nthe dissolution of nature in himself. \"The sharpness of wisdom turns\nround upon the sage: wisdom is a crime against nature\": such terrible\nexpressions does the myth call out to us: but the Hellenic poet touches\nlike a sunbeam the sublime and formidable Memnonian statue of the myth,\nso that it suddenly begins to sound--in Sophoclean melodies.", "location": 140765}
{"paragraph": "This enchantment is the prerequisite of all dramatic art. In this\nenchantment the Dionysian reveller sees himself as a satyr, _and as\nsatyr he in turn beholds the god,_ that is, in his transformation he\nsees a new vision outside him as the Apollonian consummation of his\nstate. With this new vision the drama is complete.", "location": 133056}
{"paragraph": "The most decisive word, however, for this new and unprecedented\nesteem of knowledge and insight was spoken by Socrates when he\nfound that he was the only one who acknowledged to himself that he\n_knew nothing_ while in his critical pilgrimage through Athens, and\ncalling on the greatest statesmen, orators, poets, and artists, he\ndiscovered everywhere the conceit of knowledge. He perceived, to his\nastonishment, that all these celebrities were without a proper and\naccurate insight, even with regard to their own callings, and practised\nthem only by instinct. \"Only by instinct\": with this phrase we touch\nupon the heart and core of the Socratic tendency. Socratism condemns\ntherewith existing art as well as existing ethics; wherever Socratism\nturns its searching eyes it beholds the lack of insight and the\npower of illusion; and from this lack infers the inner perversity and\nobjectionableness of existing conditions. From this point onwards,\nSocrates believed that he was called upon to, correct existence;\nand, with an air of disregard and superiority, as the precursor\nof an altogether different culture, art, and morality, he enters\nsingle-handed into a world, of which, if we reverently touched the hem,\nwe should count it our greatest happiness.", "location": 187593}

{"paragraph": "On the other hand, we should not have to speak conjecturally, if asked\nto disclose the immense gap which separated the _Dionysian Greek_ from\nthe Dionysian barbarian. From all quarters of the Ancient World--to\nsay nothing of the modern--from Rome as far as Babylon, we can prove\nthe existence of Dionysian festivals, the type of which bears, at\nbest, the same relation to the Greek festivals as the bearded satyr,\nwho borrowed his name and attributes from the goat, does to Dionysus\nhimself. In nearly every instance the centre of these festivals lay\nin extravagant sexual licentiousness, the waves of which overwhelmed\nall family life and its venerable traditions; the very wildest beasts\nof nature were let loose here, including that detestable mixture of\nlust and cruelty which has always seemed to me the genuine \"witches'\ndraught.\" For some time, however, it would seem that the Greeks\nwere perfectly secure and guarded against the feverish agitations\nof these festivals (--the knowledge of which entered Greece by all\nthe channels of land and sea) by the figure of Apollo himself rising\nhere in full pride, who could not have held out the Gorgon's head to\na more dangerous power than this grotesquely uncouth Dionysian. It\nis in Doric art that this majestically-rejecting attitude of Apollo\nperpetuated itself. This opposition became more precarious and even\nimpossible, when, from out of the deepest root of the Hellenic nature,\nsimilar impulses finally broke forth and made way for themselves:\nthe Delphic god, by a seasonably effected reconciliation, was now\ncontented with taking the destructive arms from the hands of his\npowerful antagonist. This reconciliation marks the most important\nmoment in the history of the Greek cult: wherever we turn our eyes\nwe may observe the revolutions resulting from this event. It was\nthe reconciliation of two antagonists, with the sharp demarcation\nof the boundary-lines to be thenceforth observed by each, and with\nperiodical transmission of testimonials;--in reality, the chasm was\nnot bridged over. But if we observe how, under the pressure of this\nconclusion of peace, the Dionysian power manifested itself, we shall\nnow recognise in the Dionysian orgies of the Greeks, as compared with\nthe Babylonian Sac\u00e6a and their retrogression of man to the tiger and\nthe ape, the significance of festivals of world-redemption and days of\ntransfiguration. Not till then does nature attain her artistic jubilee;\nnot till then does the rupture of the _principium individuationis_\nbecome an artistic phenomenon. That horrible \"witches' draught\" of\nsensuality and cruelty was here powerless: only the curious blending\nand duality in the emotions of the Dionysian revellers reminds one of\nit--just as medicines remind one of deadly poisons,--that phenomenon,\nto wit, that pains beget joy, that jubilation wrings painful sounds out\nof the breast. From the highest joy sounds the cry of horror or the\nyearning wail over an irretrievable loss. In these Greek festivals a\nsentimental trait, as it were, breaks forth from nature, as if she must\nsigh over her dismemberment into individuals. The song and pantomime\nof such dually-minded revellers was something new and unheard-of in\nthe Homeric-Grecian world; and the Dionysian _music_ in particular\nexcited awe and horror. If music, as it would seem, was previously\nknown as an Apollonian art, it was, strictly speaking, only as the\nwave-beat of rhythm, the formative power of which was developed to\nthe representation of Apollonian conditions. The music of Apollo was\nDoric architectonics in tones, but in merely suggested tones, such\nas those of the cithara. The very element which forms the essence of\nDionysian music (and hence of music in general) is carefully excluded\nas un-Apollonian; namely, the thrilling power of the tone, the uniform\nstream of the melos, and the thoroughly incomparable world of harmony.\nIn the Dionysian dithyramb man is incited to the highest exaltation\nof all his symbolic faculties; something never before experienced\nstruggles for utterance--the annihilation of the veil of M\u00e2y\u00e2, Oneness\nas genius of the race, ay, of nature. The essence of nature is now\nto be expressed symbolically; a new world of symbols is required;\nfor once the entire symbolism of the body, not only the symbolism of\nthe lips, face, and speech, but the whole pantomime of dancing which\nsets all the members into rhythmical motion. Thereupon the other\nsymbolic powers, those of music, in rhythmics, dynamics, and harmony,\nsuddenly become impetuous. To comprehend this collective discharge\nof all the symbolic powers, a man must have already attained that\nheight of self-abnegation, which wills to express itself symbolically\nthrough these powers: the Dithyrambic votary of Dionysus is therefore\nunderstood only by those like himself! With what astonishment must the\nApollonian Greek have beheld him! With an astonishment, which was all\nthe greater the more it was mingled with the shuddering suspicion that\nall this was in reality not so very foreign to him, yea, that, like\nunto a veil, his Apollonian consciousness only hid this Dionysian world\nfrom his view.", "location": 73063}
{"paragraph": "We shall now have to avail ourselves of all the principles of art\nhitherto considered, in order to find our way through the labyrinth,\nas we must designate _the origin of Greek tragedy._ I shall not be\ncharged with absurdity in saying that the problem of this origin has\nas yet not even been seriously stated, not to say solved, however\noften the fluttering tatters of ancient tradition have been sewed\ntogether in sundry combinations and torn asunder again. This tradition\ntells us in the most unequivocal terms, _that tragedy sprang from the\ntragic chorus,_ and was originally only chorus and nothing but chorus:\nand hence we feel it our duty to look into the heart of this tragic\nchorus as being the real proto-drama, without in the least contenting\nourselves with current art-phraseology--according to which the chorus\nis the ideal spectator, or represents the people in contrast to the\nregal side of the scene. The latter explanatory notion, which sounds\nsublime to many a politician--that the immutable moral law was embodied\nby the democratic Athenians in the popular chorus, which always carries\nits point over the passionate excesses and extravagances of kings--may\nbe ever so forcibly suggested by an observation of Aristotle: still\nit has no bearing on the original formation of tragedy, inasmuch\nas the entire antithesis of king and people, and, in general, the\nwhole politico-social sphere, is excluded from the purely religious\nbeginnings of tragedy; but, considering the well-known classical\nform of the chorus in \u00c6schylus and Sophocles, we should even deem\nit blasphemy to speak here of the anticipation of a \"constitutional\nrepresentation of the people,\" from which blasphemy others have not\nshrunk, however. The ancient governments knew of no constitutional\nrepresentation of the people _in praxi,_ and it is to be hoped that\nthey did not even so much as \"anticipate\" it in tragedy.", "location": 113604}

And again, through my diagnosing Socrates as a\ndecadent, I had given a wholly unequivocal proof of how little risk\nthe trustworthiness of my psychological grasp would run of being\nweakened by some moralistic idiosyncrasy--to view morality itself as a\nsymptom of decadence is an innovation, a novelty of the first rank in\nthe history of knowledge. How far I had leaped in either case beyond\nthe smug shallow-pate-gossip of optimism _contra_ pessimism!

How great Dionysus\nmust be among you, when the Delian god deems such charms necessary\nto cure you of your dithyrambic madness!\"--To one in this frame of\nmind, however, an aged Athenian, looking up to him with the sublime\neye of \u00c6schylus, might answer: \"Say also this, thou curious stranger:\nwhat sufferings this people must have undergone, in order to be able\nto become thus beautiful!

While the latter lives in these pictures, and only in\nthem, with joyful satisfaction, and never grows tired of contemplating\nthem with love, even in their minutest characters, while even the\npicture of the angry Achilles is to him but a picture, the angry\nexpression of which he enjoys with the dream-joy in appearance--so\nthat, by this mirror of appearance, he is guarded against being unified\nand blending with his figures;--the pictures of the lyrist on the other\nhand are nothing but _his very_ self and, as it were, only different\nprojections of himself, on account of which he as the moving centre\nof this world is entitled to say \"I\": only of course this self is\nnot the same as that of the waking, empirically real man, but the\nonly verily existent and eternal self resting at the basis of things,\nby means of the images whereof the lyric genius sees through even to\nthis basis of things. Now let us suppose that he beholds _himself_\nalso among these images as non-genius, _i.e.,_ his subject, the whole\nthrong of subjective passions and impulses of the will directed to a\ndefinite object which appears real to him; if now it seems as if the\nlyric genius and the allied non-genius were one, and as if the former\nspoke that little word \"I\" of his own accord, this appearance will no\nlonger be able to lead us astray, as it certainly led those astray who\ndesignated the lyrist as the subjective poet. In truth, Archilochus,\nthe passionately inflamed, loving and hating man, is but a vision of\nthe genius, who by this time is no longer Archilochus, but a genius\nof the world, who expresses his primordial pain symbolically in the\nfigure of the man Archilochus: while the subjectively willing and\ndesiring man, Archilochus, can never at any time be a poet. It is by no\nmeans necessary, however, that the lyrist should see nothing but the\nphenomenon of the man Archilochus before him as a reflection of eternal\nbeing; and tragedy shows how far the visionary world of the lyrist may\ndepart from this phenomenon, to which, of course, it is most intimately\nrelated.", "location": 98667}
{"paragraph": "The revelling crowd of the votaries of Dionysus rejoices, swayed by\nsuch moods and perceptions, the power of which transforms them before\ntheir own eyes, so that they imagine they behold themselves as\nreconstituted genii of nature, as satyrs. The later constitution of the\ntragic chorus is the artistic imitation of this natural phenomenon,\nwhich of course required a separation of the Dionysian spectators from\nthe enchanted Dionysians. However, we must never lose sight of the fact\nthat the public of the Attic tragedy rediscovered itself in the chorus\nof the orchestra, that there was in reality no antithesis of public\nand chorus: for all was but one great sublime chorus of dancing and\nsinging satyrs, or of such as allowed themselves to be represented by\nthe satyrs. The Schlegelian observation must here reveal itself to us\nin a deeper sense. The chorus is the \"ideal spectator\"[5] in so far as\nit is the only _beholder,_[6] the beholder of the visionary world of\nthe scene. A public of spectators, as known to us, was unknown to the\nGreeks. In their theatres the terraced structure of the spectators'\nspace rising in concentric arcs enabled every one, in the strictest\nsense, to _overlook_ the entire world of culture around him, and in\nsurfeited contemplation to imagine himself a chorist. According to\nthis view, then, we may call the chorus in its primitive stage in\nproto-tragedy, a self-mirroring of the Dionysian man: a phenomenon\nwhich may be best exemplified by the process of the actor, who, if he\nbe truly gifted, sees hovering before his eyes with almost tangible\nperceptibility the character he is to represent. The satyric chorus\nis first of all a vision of the Dionysian throng, just as the world\nof the stage is, in turn, a vision of the satyric chorus: the power\nof this vision is great enough to render the eye dull and insensible\nto the impression of \"reality,\" to the presence of the cultured men\noccupying the tiers of seats on every side. The form of the Greek\ntheatre reminds one of a lonesome mountain-valley: the architecture of\nthe scene appears like a luminous cloud-picture which the Bacchants\nswarming on the mountains behold from the heights, as the splendid\nencirclement in the midst of which the image of Dionysus is revealed to\nthem.", "location": 127740}

{"paragraph": "It has already been intimated that the Homeric epos is the poem\nof Olympian culture, wherewith this culture has sung its own song\nof triumph over the terrors of the war of the Titans. Under the\npredominating influence of tragic poetry, these Homeric myths are now\nreproduced anew, and show by this metempsychosis that meantime the\nOlympian culture also has been vanquished by a still deeper view of\nthings. The haughty Titan Prometheus has announced to his Olympian\ntormentor that the extremest danger will one day menace his rule,\nunless he ally with him betimes. In \u00c6schylus we perceive the terrified\nZeus, apprehensive of his end, in alliance with the Titan. Thus, the\nformer age of the Titans is subsequently brought from Tartarus once\nmore to the light of day. The philosophy of wild and naked nature\nbeholds with the undissembled mien of truth the myths of the Homeric\nworld as they dance past: they turn pale, they tremble before the\nlightning glance of this goddess--till the powerful fist[16] of\nthe Dionysian artist forces them into the service of the new deity.\nDionysian truth takes over the entire domain of myth as symbolism of\n_its_ knowledge, which it makes known partly in the public cult of\ntragedy and partly in the secret celebration of the dramatic mysteries,\nalways, however, in the old mythical garb. What was the power, which\nfreed Prometheus from his vultures and transformed the myth into a\nvehicle of Dionysian wisdom? It is the Heracleian power of music:\nwhich, having reached its highest manifestness in tragedy, can invest\nmyths with a new and most profound significance, which we have already\nhad occasion to characterise as the most powerful faculty of music. For\nit is the fate of every myth to insinuate itself into the narrow limits\nof some alleged historical reality, and to be treated by some later\ngeneration as a solitary fact with historical claims: and the Greeks\nwere already fairly on the way to restamp the whole of their mythical\njuvenile dream sagaciously and arbitrarily into a historico-pragmatical\n_juvenile history._ For this is the manner in which religions are\nwont to die out: when of course under the stern, intelligent eyes of\nan orthodox dogmatism, the mythical presuppositions of a religion are\nsystematised as a completed sum of historical events, and when one\nbegins apprehensively to defend the credibility of the myth, while at\nthe same time opposing all continuation of their natural vitality and\nluxuriance; when, accordingly, the feeling for myth dies out, and its\nplace is taken by the claim of religion to historical foundations.\nThis dying myth was now seized by the new-born genius of Dionysian\nmusic, in whose hands it bloomed once more, with such colours as it\nhad never yet displayed, with a fragrance that awakened a longing\nanticipation of a metaphysical world. After this final effulgence\nit collapses, its leaves wither, and soon the scoffing Lucians of\nantiquity catch at the discoloured and faded flowers which the winds\ncarry off in every direction. Through tragedy the myth attains its\nprofoundest significance, its most expressive form; it rises once more\nlike a wounded hero, and the whole surplus of vitality, together with\nthe philosophical calmness of the Dying, burns in its eyes with a last\npowerful gleam.", "location": 155944}

While this optimism, resting on apparently unobjectionable\n_\u00e6terna veritates,_ believed in the intelligibility and solvability of\nall the riddles of the world, and treated space, time, and causality\nas totally unconditioned laws of the most universal validity, Kant, on\nthe other hand, showed that these served in reality only to elevate the\nmere phenomenon, the work of M\u00e2y\u00e2, to the sole and highest reality,\nputting it in place of the innermost and true essence of things, thus\nmaking the actual knowledge of this essence impossible, that is,\naccording to the expression of Schopenhauer, to lull the dreamer still\nmore soundly asleep (_Welt als Wille und Vorstellung,_ I. 498).

{"paragraph": "The _chorus_ of Greek tragedy, the symbol of the mass of the people\nmoved by Dionysian excitement, is thus fully explained by our\nconception of it as here set forth. Whereas, being accustomed to the\nposition of a chorus on the modern stage, especially an operatic\nchorus, we could never comprehend why the tragic chorus of the Greeks\nshould be older, more primitive, indeed, more important than the\n\"action\" proper,--as has been so plainly declared by the voice of\ntradition; whereas, furthermore, we could not reconcile with this\ntraditional paramount importance and primitiveness the fact of the\nchorus' being composed only of humble, ministering beings; indeed, at\nfirst only of goatlike satyrs; whereas, finally, the orchestra before\nthe scene was always a riddle to us; we have learned to comprehend at\nlength that the scene, together with the action, was fundamentally\nand originally conceived only as a _vision,_ that the only reality\nis just the chorus, which of itself generates the vision and speaks\nthereof with the entire symbolism of dancing, tone, and word. This\nchorus beholds in the vision its lord and master Dionysus, and is thus\nfor ever the _serving_ chorus: it sees how he, the god, suffers and\nglorifies himself, and therefore does not itself _act_. But though its\nattitude towards the god is throughout the attitude of ministration,\nthis is nevertheless the highest expression, the Dionysian expression\nof _Nature,_ and therefore, like Nature herself, the chorus utters\noracles and wise sayings when transported with enthusiasm: as\n_fellow-sufferer_ it is also the _sage_ proclaiming truth from out the\nheart of Nature. Thus, then, originates the fantastic figure, which\nseems so shocking, of the wise and enthusiastic satyr, who is at the\nsame time \"the dumb man\" in contrast to the god: the image of Nature\nand her strongest impulses, yea, the symbol of Nature, and at the same\ntime the herald of her art and wisdom: musician, poet, dancer, and\nvisionary in one person.", "location": 134280}

In\ncontrast to all those who are intent on deriving the arts from one\nexclusive principle, as the necessary vital source of every work of\nart, I keep my eyes fixed on the two artistic deities of the Greeks,\nApollo and Dionysus, and recognise in them the living and conspicuous\nrepresentatives of _two_ worlds of art which differ in their intrinsic\nessence and in their highest aims. Apollo stands before me as the\ntransfiguring genius of the _principium individuationis_ through\nwhich alone the redemption in appearance is to be truly attained,\nwhile by the mystical cheer of Dionysus the spell of individuation\nis broken, and the way lies open to the Mothers of Being,[20] to the\ninnermost heart of things. This extraordinary antithesis, which opens\nup yawningly between plastic art as the Apollonian and music as the\nDionysian art, has become manifest to only one of the great thinkers,\nto such an extent that, even without this key to the symbolism of the\nHellenic divinities, he allowed to music a different character and\norigin in advance of all the other arts, because, unlike them, it is\nnot a copy of the phenomenon, but a direct copy of the will itself, and\ntherefore represents _the metaphysical of everything physical in the\nworld_, the thing-in-itself of every phenomenon. (Schopenhauer, _Welt\nals Wille und Vorstellung,_ I. 310.) To this most important perception\nof \u00e6sthetics (with which, taken in a serious sense, \u00e6sthetics properly\ncommences), Richard Wagner, by way of confirmation of its eternal\ntruth, affixed his seal, when he asserted in his _Beethoven_ that\nmusic must be judged according to \u00e6sthetic principles quite different\nfrom those which apply to the plastic arts, and not, in general,\naccording to the category of beauty: although an erroneous \u00e6sthetics,\ninspired by a misled and degenerate art, has by virtue of the concept\nof beauty prevailing in the plastic domain accustomed itself to demand\nof music an effect analogous to that of the works of plastic art,\nnamely the suscitating _delight in beautiful forms._ Upon perceiving\nthis extraordinary antithesis, I felt a strong inducement to approach\nthe essence of Greek tragedy, and, by means of it, the profoundest\nrevelation of Hellenic genius: for I at last thought myself to be in\npossession of a charm to enable me--far beyond the phraseology of our\nusual \u00e6sthetics--to represent vividly to my mind the primitive problem\nof tragedy: whereby such an astounding insight into the Hellenic\ncharacter was afforded me that it necessarily seemed as if our proudly\ncomporting classico-Hellenic science had thus far contrived to subsist\nalmost exclusively on phantasmagoria and externalities.", "location": 214562}

{"paragraph": "He who recalls the immediate consequences of this restlessly\nonward-pressing spirit of science will realise at once that _myth_\nwas annihilated by it, and that, in consequence of this annihilation,\npoetry was driven as a homeless being from her natural ideal soil.\nIf we have rightly assigned to music the capacity to reproduce myth\nfrom itself, we may in turn expect to find the spirit of science on\nthe path where it inimically opposes this mythopoeic power of music.\nThis takes place in the development of the _New Attic Dithyramb,_ the\nmusic of which no longer expressed the inner essence, the will itself,\nbut only rendered the phenomenon insufficiently, in an imitation by\nmeans of concepts; from which intrinsically degenerate music the truly\nmusical natures turned away with the same repugnance that they felt\nfor the art-destroying tendency of Socrates. The unerring instinct of\nAristophanes surely did the proper thing when it comprised Socrates\nhimself, the tragedy of Euripides, and the music of the new Dithyrambic\npoets in the same feeling of hatred, and perceived in all three\nphenomena the symptoms of a degenerate culture. By this New Dithyramb,\nmusic has in an outrageous manner been made the imitative portrait of\nphenomena, for instance, of a battle or a storm at sea, and has thus,\nof course, been entirely deprived of its mythopoeic power. For if it\nendeavours to excite our delight only by compelling us to seek external\nanalogies between a vital or natural process and certain rhythmical\nfigures and characteristic sounds of music; if our understanding is\nexpected to satisfy itself with the perception of these analogies, we\nare reduced to a frame of mind in which the reception of the mythical\nis impossible; for the myth as a unique exemplar of generality\nand truth towering into the infinite, desires to be conspicuously\nperceived. The truly Dionysean music presents itself to us as such\na general mirror of the universal will: the conspicuous event which\nis refracted in this mirror expands at once for our consciousness to\nthe copy of an eternal truth. Conversely, such a conspicious event is\nat once divested of every mythical character by the tone-painting\nof the New Dithyramb; music has here become a wretched copy of the\nphenomenon, and therefore infinitely poorer than the phenomenon itself:\nthrough which poverty it still further reduces even the phenomenon for\nour consciousness, so that now, for instance, a musically imitated\nbattle of this sort exhausts itself in marches, signal-sounds, etc.,\nand our imagination is arrested precisely by these superficialities.\nTone-painting is therefore in every respect the counterpart of true\nmusic with its mythopoeic power: through it the phenomenon, poor in\nitself, is made still poorer, while through an isolated Dionysian music\nthe phenomenon is evolved and expanded into a picture of the world.\nIt was an immense triumph of the non-Dionysian spirit, when, in the\ndevelopment of the New Dithyramb, it had estranged music from itself\nand reduced it to be the slave of phenomena.

Here we shall ask first of all where that new\ngerm which subsequently developed into tragedy and dramatic dithyramb\nfirst makes itself perceptible in the Hellenic world. The ancients\nthemselves supply the answer in symbolic form, when they place _Homer_\nand _Archilochus_ as the forefathers and torch-bearers of Greek poetry\nside by side on gems, sculptures, etc., in the sure conviction that\nonly these two thoroughly original compeers, from whom a stream of\nfire flows over the whole of Greek posterity, should be taken into\nconsideration.

Is the Dionysian entitled\nto exist at all? Should it not be forcibly rooted out of the Hellenic\nsoil? Certainly, the poet tells us, if only it were possible: but the\ngod Dionysus is too powerful; his most intelligent adversary--like\nPentheus in the \"Bacch\u00e6\"--is unwittingly enchanted by him, and\nin this enchantment meets his fate. The judgment of the two old\nsages, Cadmus and Tiresias, seems to be also the judgment of the\naged poet: that the reflection of the wisest individuals does not\noverthrow old popular traditions, nor the perpetually propagating\nworship of Dionysus, that in fact it behoves us to display at least a\ndiplomatically cautious concern in the presence of such strange forces:\nwhere however it is always possible that the god may take offence\nat such lukewarm participation, and finally change the diplomat--in\nthis case Cadmus--into a dragon.

Here also we observe the victory of\nthe phenomenon over the Universal, and the delight in the particular\nquasi-anatomical preparation; we actually breathe the air of a\ntheoretical world, in which scientific knowledge is valued more highly\nthan the artistic reflection of a universal law.

Like the artist, the theorist also finds an infinite\nsatisfaction in what _is_ and, like the former, he is shielded by this\nsatisfaction from the practical ethics of pessimism with its lynx eyes\nwhich shine only in the dark. For if the artist in every unveiling\nof truth always cleaves with raptured eyes only to that which still\nremains veiled after the unveiling, the theoretical man, on the other\nhand, enjoys and contents himself with the cast-off veil, and finds\nthe consummation of his pleasure in the process of a continuously\nsuccessful unveiling through his own unaided efforts. There would\nhave been no science if it had only been concerned about that _one_\nnaked goddess and nothing else. For then its disciples would have been\nobliged to feel like those who purposed to dig a hole straight through\nthe earth: each one of whom perceives that with the utmost lifelong\nexertion he is able to excavate only a very little of the enormous\ndepth, which is again filled up before his eyes by the labours of his\nsuccessor, so that a third man seems to do well when on his own account\nhe selects a new spot for his attempts at tunnelling. If now some one\nproves conclusively that the antipodal goal cannot be attained in this\ndirect way, who will still care to toil on in the old depths, unless he\nhas learned to content himself in the meantime with finding precious\nstones or discovering natural laws? For that reason Lessing, the most\nhonest theoretical man, ventured to say that he cared more for the\nsearch after truth than for truth itself: in saying which he revealed\nthe fundamental secret of science, to the astonishment, and indeed,\nto the vexation of scientific men. Well, to be sure, there stands\nalongside of this detached perception, as an excess of honesty, if not\nof presumption, a profound _illusion_ which first came to the world\nin the person of Socrates, the imperturbable belief that, by means\nof the clue of causality, thinking reaches to the deepest abysses of\nbeing, and that thinking is able not only to perceive being but even\nto _correct_ it. This sublime metaphysical illusion is added as an\ninstinct to science and again and again leads the latter to its limits,\nwhere it must change into _art; which is really the end, to be attained\nby this mechanism_.", "location": 204553}
{"paragraph": "Of course, the Apollonian light-picture did not, precisely with this\ninner illumination through music, attain the peculiar effect of the\nweaker grades of Apollonian art. What the epos and the animated stone\ncan do--constrain the contemplating eye to calm delight in the world\nof the _individuatio_--could not be realised here, notwithstanding\nthe greater animation and distinctness. We contemplated the drama\nand penetrated with piercing glance into its inner agitated world of\nmotives--and yet it seemed as if only a symbolic picture passed before\nus, the profoundest significance of which we almost believed we had\ndivined, and which we desired to put aside like a curtain in order to\nbehold the original behind it. The greatest distinctness of the picture\ndid not suffice us: for it seemed to reveal as well as veil something;\nand while it seemed, with its symbolic revelation, to invite the\nrending of the veil for the disclosure of the mysterious background,\nthis illumined all-conspicuousness itself enthralled the eye and\nprevented it from penetrating more deeply He who has not experienced\nthis,--to have to view, and at the same time to have a longing\nbeyond the viewing,--will hardly be able to conceive how clearly and\ndefinitely these two processes coexist in the contemplation of tragic\nmyth and are felt to be conjoined; while the truly \u00e6sthetic spectators\nwill confirm my assertion that among the peculiar effects of tragedy\nthis conjunction is the most noteworthy. Now let this phenomenon of the\n\u00e6sthetic spectator be transferred to an analogous process in the tragic\nartist, and the genesis of _tragic myth_ will have been understood. It\nshares with the Apollonian sphere of art the full delight in appearance\nand contemplation, and at the same time it denies this delight and\nfinds a still higher satisfaction in the annihilation of the visible\nworld of appearance. The substance of tragic myth is first of all an\nepic event involving the glorification of the fighting hero: but whence\noriginates the essentially enigmatical trait, that the suffering in\nthe fate of the hero, the most painful victories, the most agonising\ncontrasts of motives, in short, the exemplification of the wisdom of\nSilenus, or, \u00e6sthetically expressed, the Ugly and Discordant, is always\nrepresented anew in such countless forms with such predilection, and\nprecisely in the most youthful and exuberant age of a people, unless\nthere is really a higher delight experienced in all this?", "location": 307345}

For the rectification\nof our \u00e6sthetic knowledge we previously borrowed from them the two\ndivine figures, each of which sways a separate realm of art, and\nconcerning whose mutual contact and exaltation we have acquired a\nnotion through Greek tragedy. Through a remarkable disruption of both\nthese primitive artistic impulses, the ruin of Greek tragedy seemed\nto be necessarily brought about: with which process a degeneration\nand a transmutation of the Greek national character was strictly in\nkeeping, summoning us to earnest reflection as to how closely and\nnecessarily art and the people, myth and custom, tragedy and the state,\nhave coalesced in their bases. The ruin of tragedy was at the same\ntime the ruin of myth. Until then the Greeks had been involuntarily\ncompelled immediately to associate all experiences with their myths,\nindeed they had to comprehend them only through this association:\nwhereby even the most immediate present necessarily appeared to them\n_sub specie \u00e6terni_ and in a certain sense as timeless. Into this\ncurrent of the timeless, however, the state as well as art plunged\nin order to find repose from the burden and eagerness of the moment.\nAnd a people--for the rest, also a man--is worth just as much only as\nits ability to impress on its experiences the seal of eternity: for\nit is thus, as it were, desecularised, and reveals its unconscious\ninner conviction of the relativity of time and of the true, that is,\nthe metaphysical significance of life. The contrary happens when a\npeople begins to comprehend itself historically and to demolish the\nmythical bulwarks around it: with which there is usually connected\na marked secularisation, a breach with the unconscious metaphysics\nof its earlier existence, in all ethical consequences. Greek art and\nespecially Greek tragedy delayed above all the annihilation of myth:\nit was necessary to annihilate these also to be able to live detached\nfrom the native soil, unbridled in the wilderness of thought, custom,\nand action. Even in such circumstances this metaphysical impulse still\nendeavours to create for itself a form of apotheosis (weakened, no\ndoubt) in the Socratism of science urging to life: but on its lower\nstage this same impulse led only to a feverish search, which gradually\nmerged into a pandemonium of myths and superstitions accumulated from\nall quarters: in the midst of which, nevertheless, the Hellene sat with\na yearning heart till he contrived, as Gr\u00e6culus, to mask his fever with\nGreek cheerfulness and Greek levity, or to narcotise himself completely\nwith some gloomy Oriental superstition.", "location": 301520}

Some of the philological\nessays he had written in his student days, and which were published\nby the _Rheinische Museum,_ had attracted the attention of the\nEducational Board at Bale. Ratsherr Wilhelm Vischer, as representing\nthis body, appealed to Ritschl for fuller information.

{"paragraph": "The listener, who insists on distinctly hearing the words under the\nmusic, has his wishes met by the singer in that he speaks rather than\nsings, and intensifies the pathetic expression of the words in this\nhalf-song: by this intensification of the pathos he facilitates the\nunderstanding of the words and surmounts the remaining half of the\nmusic. The specific danger which now threatens him is that in some\nunguarded moment he may give undue importance to music, which would\nforthwith result in the destruction of the pathos of the speech and\nthe distinctness of the words: while, on the other hand, he always\nfeels himself impelled to musical delivery and to virtuose exhibition\nof vocal talent. Here the \"poet\" comes to his aid, who knows how to\nprovide him with abundant opportunities for lyrical interjections,\nrepetitions of words and sentences, etc.,--at which places the singer,\nnow in the purely musical element, can rest himself without minding the\nwords. This alternation of emotionally impressive, yet only half-sung\nspeech and wholly sung interjections, which is characteristic of the\n_stilo rappresentativo,_ this rapidly changing endeavour to operate\nnow on the conceptional and representative faculty of the hearer, now\non his musical sense, is something so thoroughly unnatural and withal\nso intrinsically contradictory both to the Apollonian and Dionysian\nartistic impulses, that one has to infer an origin of the recitative\nforeign to all artistic instincts. The recitative must be defined,\naccording to this description, as the combination of epic and lyric\ndelivery, not indeed as an intrinsically stable combination which\ncould not be attained in the case of such totally disparate elements,\nbut an entirely superficial mosaic conglutination, such as is totally\nunprecedented in the domain of nature and experience. _But this was\nnot the opinion of the inventors of the recitative:_ they themselves,\nand their age with them, believed rather that the mystery of antique\nmusic had been solved by this _stilo rappresentativo,_ in which, as\nthey thought, the only explanation of the enormous influence of an\nOrpheus, an Amphion, and even of Greek tragedy was to be found. The new\nstyle was regarded by them as the re-awakening of the most effective\nmusic, the Old Greek music: indeed, with the universal and popular\nconception of the Homeric world _as the primitive world,_ they could\nabandon themselves to the dream of having descended once more into the\nparadisiac beginnings of mankind, wherein music also must needs have\nhad the unsurpassed purity, power, and innocence of which the poets\ncould give such touching accounts in their pastoral plays. Here we see\ninto the internal process of development of this thoroughly modern\nvariety of art, the opera: a powerful need here acquires an art, but\nit is a need of an un\u00e6sthetic kind: the yearning for the idyll, the\nbelief in the prehistoric existence of the artistic, good man. The\nrecitative was regarded as the rediscovered language of this primitive\nman; the opera as the recovered land of this idyllically or heroically\ngood creature, who in every action follows at the same time a natural\nartistic impulse, who sings a little along with all he has to say, in\norder to sing immediately with full voice on the slightest emotional\nexcitement. It is now a matter of indifference to us that the humanists\nof those days combated the old ecclesiastical representation of man\nas naturally corrupt and lost, with this new-created picture of the\nparadisiac artist: so that opera may be understood as the oppositional\ndogma of the good man, whereby however a solace was at the same time\nfound for the pessimism to which precisely the seriously-disposed\nmen of that time were most strongly incited, owing to the frightful\nuncertainty of all conditions of life. It is enough to have perceived\nthat the intrinsic charm, and therefore the genesis, of this new form\nof art lies in the gratification of an altogether un\u00e6sthetic need, in\nthe optimistic glorification of man as such, in the conception of the\nprimitive man as the man naturally good and artistic: a principle of\nthe opera which has gradually changed into a threatening and terrible\n_demand,_ which, in face of the socialistic movements of the present\ntime, we can no longer ignore.

And it is perhaps not only the agreeable\nand friendly pictures that he realises in himself with such perfect\nunderstanding: the earnest, the troubled, the dreary, the gloomy, the\nsudden checks, the tricks of fortune, the uneasy presentiments, in\nshort, the whole \"Divine Comedy\" of life, and the Inferno, also pass\nbefore him, not merely like pictures on the wall--for he too lives and\nsuffers in these scenes,--and yet not without that fleeting sensation\nof appearance. And perhaps many a one will, like myself, recollect\nhaving sometimes called out cheeringly and not without success amid the\ndangers and terrors of dream-life: \"It is a dream! I will dream on!\" I\nhave likewise been told of persons capable of continuing the causality\nof one and the same dream for three and even more successive nights:\nall of which facts clearly testify that our innermost being, the common\nsubstratum of all of us, experiences our dreams with deep joy and\ncheerful acquiescence.", "location": 62354}

Tragic myth, in so far as it really belongs\nto art, also fully participates in this transfiguring metaphysical\npurpose of art in general: What does it transfigure, however, when it\npresents the phenomenal world in the guise of the suffering hero?

{"paragraph": "Perhaps we may lead up to this primitive problem with the question:\nwhat \u00e6sthetic effect results when the intrinsically separate\nart-powers, the Apollonian and the Dionysian, enter into concurrent\nactions? Or, in briefer form: how is music related to image and\nconcept?--Schopenhauer, whom Richard Wagner, with especial reference to\nthis point, accredits with an unsurpassable clearness and perspicuity\nof exposition, expresses himself most copiously on the subject in\nthe following passage which I shall cite here at full length[21]\n(_Welt als Wille und Vorstellung,_ I. p. 309): \"According to all\nthis, we may regard the phenomenal world, or nature, and music as\ntwo different expressions of the same thing,[20] which is therefore\nitself the only medium of the analogy between these two expressions,\nso that a knowledge of this medium is required in order to understand\nthat analogy. Music, therefore, if regarded as an expression of the\nworld, is in the highest degree a universal language, which is related\nindeed to the universality of concepts, much as these are related to\nthe particular things. Its universality, however, is by no means the\nempty universality of abstraction, but of quite a different kind, and\nis united with thorough and distinct definiteness. In this respect it\nresembles geometrical figures and numbers, which are the universal\nforms of all possible objects of experience and applicable to them all\n_a priori_, and yet are not abstract but perceptiple and thoroughly\ndeterminate. All possible efforts, excitements and manifestations of\nwill, all that goes on in the heart of man and that reason includes in\nthe wide, negative concept of feeling, may be expressed by the infinite\nnumber of possible melodies, but always in the universality of mere\nform, without the material, always according to the thing-in-itself,\nnot the phenomenon,--of which they reproduce the very soul and essence\nas it were, without the body. This deep relation which music bears to\nthe true nature of all things also explains the fact that suitable\nmusic played to any scene, action, event, or surrounding seems to\ndisclose to us its most secret meaning, and appears as the most\naccurate and distinct commentary upon it; as also the fact that whoever\ngives himself up entirely to the impression of a symphony seems to see\nall the possible events of life and the world take place in himself:\nnevertheless upon reflection he can find no likeness between the music\nand the things that passed before his mind. For, as we have said, music\nis distinguished from all the other arts by the fact that it is not a\ncopy of the phenomenon, or, more accurately, the adequate objectivity\nof the will, but the direct copy of the will itself, and therefore\nrepresents the metaphysical of everything physical in the world, and\nthe thing-in-itself of every phenomenon. We might, therefore, just as\nwell call the world embodied music as embodied will: and this is the\nreason why music makes every picture, and indeed every scene of real\nlife and of the world, at once appear with higher significance; all the\nmore so, to be sure, in proportion as its melody is analogous to the\ninner spirit of the given phenomenon. It rests upon this that we are\nable to set a poem to music as a song, or a perceptible representation\nas a pantomime, or both as an opera. Such particular pictures of human\nlife, set to the universal language of music, are never bound to it\nor correspond to it with stringent necessity, but stand to it only\nin the relation of an example chosen at will to a general concept.\nIn the determinateness of the real they represent that which music\nexpresses in the universality of mere form. For melodies are to a\ncertain extent, like general concepts, an abstraction from the actual.\nThis actual world, then, the world of particular things, affords the\nobject of perception, the special and the individual, the particular\ncase, both to the universality of concepts and to the universality of\nthe melodies. But these two universalities are in a certain respect\nopposed to each other; for the concepts contain only the forms, which\nare first of all abstracted from perception,--the separated outward\nshell of things, as it were,--and hence they are, in the strictest\nsense of the term, _abstracta_; music, on the other hand, gives the\ninmost kernel which precedes all forms, or the heart of things. This\nrelation may be very well expressed in the language of the schoolmen,\nby saying: the concepts are the _universalia post rem,_ but music gives\nthe _universalia ante rem,_ and the real world the _universalia in\nre._--But that in general a relation is possible between a composition\nand a perceptible representation rests, as we have said, upon the\nfact that both are simply different expressions of the same inner\nbeing of the world. When now, in the particular case, such a relation\nis actually given, that is to say, when the composer has been able to\nexpress in the universal language of music the emotions of will which\nconstitute the heart of an event, then the melody of the song, the\nmusic of the opera, is expressive. But the analogy discovered by the\ncomposer between the two must have proceeded from the direct knowledge\nof the nature of the world unknown to his reason, and must not be an\nimitation produced with conscious intention by means of conceptions;\notherwise the music does not express the inner nature of the will\nitself, but merely gives an inadequate imitation of its phenomenon: all\nspecially imitative music does this.\"", "location": 217359}

To be able\nto live, the Greeks had, from direst necessity, to create these gods:\nwhich process we may perhaps picture to ourselves in this manner: that\nout of the original Titan thearchy of terror the Olympian thearchy of\njoy was evolved, by slow transitions, through the Apollonian impulse to\nbeauty, even as roses break forth from thorny bushes. How else could\nthis so sensitive people, so vehement in its desires, so singularly\nqualified for _sufferings_ have endured existence, if it had not been\nexhibited to them in their gods, surrounded with a higher glory?\nThe same impulse which calls art into being, as the complement and\nconsummation of existence, seducing to a continuation of life, caused\nalso the Olympian world to arise, in which the Hellenic \"will\" held\nup before itself a transfiguring mirror. Thus do the gods justify the\nlife of man, in that they themselves live it--the only satisfactory\nTheodicy! Existence under the bright sunshine of such gods is regarded\nas that which is desirable in itself, and the real _grief_ of the\nHomeric men has reference to parting from it, especially to early\nparting: so that we might now say of them, with a reversion of the\nSilenian wisdom, that \"to die early is worst of all for them, the\nsecond worst is--some day to die at all.\" If once the lamentation is\nheard, it will ring out again, of the short-lived Achilles, of the\nleaf-like change and vicissitude of the human race, of the decay of\nthe heroic age. It is not unworthy of the greatest hero to long for a\ncontinuation of life, ay, even as a day-labourer.

{"paragraph": "Should it have been established by our analysis that the Apollonian\nelement in tragedy has by means of its illusion gained a complete\nvictory over the Dionysian primordial element of music, and has made\nmusic itself subservient to its end, namely, the highest and clearest\nelucidation of the drama, it would certainly be necessary to add the\nvery important restriction: that at the most essential point this\nApollonian illusion is dissolved and annihilated. The drama, which, by\nthe aid of music, spreads out before us with such inwardly illumined\ndistinctness in all its movements and figures, that we imagine we\nsee the texture unfolding on the loom as the shuttle flies to and\nfro,--attains as a whole an effect which _transcends all Apollonian\nartistic effects._ In the collective effect of tragedy, the Dionysian\ngets the upper hand once more; tragedy ends with a sound which could\nnever emanate from the realm of Apollonian art. And the Apollonian\nillusion is thereby found to be what it is,--the assiduous veiling\nduring the performance of tragedy of the intrinsically Dionysian\neffect: which, however, is so powerful, that it finally forces\nthe Apollonian drama itself into a sphere where it begins to talk\nwith Dionysian wisdom, and even denies itself and its Apollonian\nconspicuousness. Thus then the intricate relation of the Apollonian and\nthe Dionysian in tragedy must really be symbolised by a fraternal union\nof the two deities: Dionysus speaks the language of Apollo; Apollo,\nhowever, finally speaks the language of Dionysus; and so the highest\ngoal of tragedy and of art in general is attained.", "location": 285592}

Socrates, the\ndialectical hero in Platonic drama, reminds us of the kindred nature\nof the Euripidean hero, who has to defend his actions by arguments and\ncounter-arguments, and thereby so often runs the risk of forfeiting\nour tragic pity; for who could mistake the _optimistic_ element\nin the essence of dialectics, which celebrates a jubilee in every\nconclusion, and can breathe only in cool clearness and consciousness:\nthe optimistic element, which, having once forced its way into tragedy,\nmust gradually overgrow its Dionysian regions, and necessarily impel it\nto self-destruction--even to the death-leap into the bourgeois drama.\nLet us but realise the consequences of the Socratic maxims: \"Virtue is\nknowledge; man only sins from ignorance; he who is virtuous is happy\":\nthese three fundamental forms of optimism involve the death of tragedy.\nFor the virtuous hero must now be a dialectician; there must now be a\nnecessary, visible connection between virtue and knowledge, between\nbelief and morality; the transcendental justice of the plot in \u00c6schylus\nis now degraded to the superficial and audacious principle of poetic\njustice with its usual _deus ex machina_.", "location": 196883}

The world, that is, the redemption of God\n_attained_ at every moment, as the perpetually changing, perpetually\nnew vision of the most suffering, most antithetical, most contradictory\nbeing, who contrives to redeem himself only in _appearance:_ this\nentire artist-metaphysics, call it arbitrary, idle, fantastic, if\nyou will,--the point is, that it already betrays a spirit, which is\ndetermined some day, at all hazards, to make a stand against the\n_moral_ interpretation and significance of life. Here, perhaps for the\nfirst time, a pessimism \"Beyond Good and Evil\" announces itself, here\nthat \"perverseness of disposition\" obtains expression and formulation,\nagainst which Schopenhauer never grew tired of hurling beforehand his\nangriest imprecations and thunderbolts,--a philosophy which dares to\nput, derogatorily put, morality itself in the world of phenomena, and\nnot only among \"phenomena\" (in the sense of the idealistic _terminus\ntechnicus_), but among the \"illusions,\" as appearance, semblance,\nerror, interpretation, accommodation, art. Perhaps the depth of this\n_antimoral_ tendency may be best estimated from the guarded and\nhostile silence with which Christianity is treated throughout this\nbook,--Christianity, as being the most extravagant burlesque of the\nmoral theme to which mankind has hitherto been obliged to listen. In\nfact, to the purely \u00e6sthetic world-interpretation and justification\ntaught in this book, there is no greater antithesis than the Christian\ndogma, which is _only_ and will be only moral, and which, with\nits absolute standards, for instance, its truthfulness of God,\nrelegates--that is, disowns, convicts, condemns--art, _all_ art, to\nthe realm of _falsehood._ Behind such a mode of thought and valuation,\nwhich, if at all genuine, must be hostile to art, I always experienced\nwhat was _hostile to life,_ the wrathful, vindictive counterwill to\nlife itself: for all life rests on appearance, art, illusion, optics,\nnecessity of perspective and error. From the very first Christianity\nwas, essentially and thoroughly, the nausea and surfeit of Life for\nLife, which only disguised, concealed and decked itself out under the\nbelief in \"another\" or \"better\" life. The hatred of the \"world,\" the\ncurse on the affections, the fear of beauty and sensuality, another\nworld, invented for the purpose of slandering this world the more,\nat bottom a longing for. Nothingness, for the end, for rest, for the\n\"Sabbath of Sabbaths\"--all this, as also the unconditional will of\nChristianity to recognise _only_ moral values, has always appeared to\nme as the most dangerous and ominous of all possible forms of a \"will\nto perish\"; at the least, as the symptom of a most fatal disease, of\nprofoundest weariness, despondency, exhaustion, impoverishment of\nlife,--for before the tribunal of morality (especially Christian, that\nis, unconditional morality) life _must_ constantly and inevitably be\nthe loser, because life _is_ something essentially unmoral,--indeed,\noppressed with the weight of contempt and the everlasting No, life\n_must_ finally be regarded as unworthy of desire, as in itself\nunworthy. Morality itself what?--may not morality be a \"will to\ndisown life,\" a secret instinct for annihilation, a principle of\ndecay, of depreciation, of slander, a beginning of the end? And,\nconsequently, the danger of dangers?...

{"paragraph": "In the same work Schopenhauer has described to us the stupendous _awe_\nwhich seizes upon man, when of a sudden he is at a loss to account for\nthe cognitive forms of a phenomenon, in that the principle of reason,\nin some one of its manifestations, seems to admit of an exception.\nAdd to this awe the blissful ecstasy which rises from the innermost\ndepths of man, ay, of nature, at this same collapse of the _principium\nindividuationis,_ and we shall gain an insight into the being of\nthe _Dionysian,_ which is brought within closest ken perhaps by the\nanalogy of _drunkenness._ It is either under the influence of the\nnarcotic draught, of which the hymns of all primitive men and peoples\ntell us, or by the powerful approach of spring penetrating all nature\nwith joy, that those Dionysian emotions awake, in the augmentation of\nwhich the subjective vanishes to complete self-forgetfulness. So also\nin the German Middle Ages singing and dancing crowds, ever increasing\nin number, were borne from place to place under this same Dionysian\npower. In these St. John's and St. Vitus's dancers we again perceive\nthe Bacchic choruses of the Greeks, with their previous history in Asia\nMinor, as far back as Babylon and the orgiastic Sac\u00e6a. There are some,\nwho, from lack of experience or obtuseness, will turn away from such\nphenomena as \"folk-diseases\" with a smile of contempt or pity prompted\nby the consciousness of their own health: of course, the poor wretches\ndo not divine what a cadaverous-looking and ghastly aspect this very\n\"health\" of theirs presents when the glowing life of the Dionysian\nrevellers rushes past them.", "location": 66645}
{"paragraph": "The new un-Dionysian spirit, however, manifests itself most clearly in\nthe _d\u00e9nouements_ of the new dramas. In the Old Tragedy one could feel\nat the close the metaphysical comfort, without which the delight in\ntragedy cannot be explained at all; the conciliating tones from another\nworld sound purest, perhaps, in the \u0152dipus at Colonus. Now that the\ngenius of music has fled from tragedy, tragedy is, strictly speaking,\ndead: for from whence could one now draw the metaphysical comfort? One\nsought, therefore, for an earthly unravelment of the tragic dissonance;\nthe hero, after he had been sufficiently tortured by fate, reaped a\nwell-deserved reward through a superb marriage or divine tokens of\nfavour. The hero had turned gladiator, on whom, after being liberally\nbattered about and covered with wounds, freedom was occasionally\nbestowed. The _deus ex machina_ took the place of metaphysical comfort.\nI will not say that the tragic view of things was everywhere completely\ndestroyed by the intruding spirit of the un-Dionysian: we only know\nthat it was compelled to flee from art into the under-world as it were,\nin the degenerate form of a secret cult. Over the widest extent of the\nHellenic character, however, there raged the consuming blast of this\nspirit, which manifests itself in the form of \"Greek cheerfulness,\"\nwhich we have already spoken of as a senile, unproductive love of\nexistence; this cheerfulness is the counterpart of the splendid\n\"na\u00efvet\u00e9\" of the earlier Greeks, which, according to the characteristic\nindicated above, must be conceived as the blossom of the Apollonian\nculture growing out of a dark abyss, as the victory which the Hellenic\nwill, through its mirroring of beauty, obtains over suffering and the\nwisdom of suffering. The noblest manifestation of that other form of\n\"Greek cheerfulness,\" the Alexandrine, is the cheerfulness of the\n_theoretical man_: it exhibits the same symptomatic characteristics as\nI have just inferred concerning the spirit of the un-Dionysian:--it\ncombats Dionysian wisdom and art, it seeks to dissolve myth, it\nsubstitutes for metaphysical comfort an earthly consonance, in fact, a\n_deus ex machina_ of its own, namely the god of machines and crucibles,\nthat is, the powers of the genii of nature recognised and employed in\nthe service of higher egoism; it believes in amending the world by\nknowledge, in guiding life by science, and that it can really confine\nthe individual within a narrow sphere of solvable problems, where he\ncheerfully says to life: \"I desire thee: it is worth while to know\nthee.\"", "location": 236243}
